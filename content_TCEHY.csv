TCEHY	There have been plenty of curveballs and much confusion since Donald Trump moved in to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. But for investors, the latest head scratcher comes from conflict over just how protectionist America’s trade policies will actually become. Stock markets SPX, -2.19% were in turmoil last week on fears of an all-out trade war with China, with the Dow sliding precipitously and now at risk of its worst March performance in almost 40 years. But after some attempted damage control by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is “cautiously hopeful” a deal on trade can be reached, stocks DJIA, -2.34% bounced back to start this week. Given that there are about two weeks until we know just what goods the Trump administration plans to target and how much to tax them, we may see further developments to soften the blow. But investors shouldn’t be fooled. Make no mistake: A trade war is clearly coming. Protectionist policies on trade, after all, are one of the few things Trump has been consistent on. This is a guy who made the dynamics of trade with China a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign. No one should be surprised that the White House unilaterally launched tariffs on imported steel and aluminum this month. And given the president’s recent desire to revert to the blustering promises of his 2016 campaign, it seems all but certain that we will see more moves like this in the coming months. So how do you protect your portfolio from a trade war? And what, if any, are the opportunities? Do you hate politics? Here's how you could profit from it using ETFs Based on the chatter of the past few weeks and the weirdly consistent views of our often capricious president, here’s what I think is the natural evolution of trade policies in 2018 and how to trade these emerging trends. Think small (caps) The most comprehensive way to insulate your portfolio from any big changes in trade policies is to simply focus on stocks that don’t have exposure to international trade. That means small U.S. stocks, particularly those in the service industry. The simplest shift, then, is to simply gravitate toward a small-cap index fund like the iShares Russell 2000 ETF IWM, -1.99% which has top holdings like food delivery service GrubHub Inc. GRUB, -3.08% or the Vanguard S&P Small-Cap ETF VB, -1.93%  that’s benchmarked to the S&P 600 index of smaller stocks that includes plays like biopharmaceutical company Nektar Therapeutics NKTR, -7.46% Consider that while the large-cap S&P 500 is down more than 5% since its highs in early March, both of these funds are down roughly 3% in the same period. It’s not ideal to simply be losing less money, of course, so it’s worth noting that select small caps have put up impressive gains lately — such as weight-loss company Medifast MED, +0.59% and quirky e-commerce platform Etsy ETSY, -3.19% which are both up around 30% year-to-date. Both are in domestic niches insulated from foreign trade turmoil. An added plus is that small caps with a big U.S. focus benefit from the tax breaks passed at the end of last year, since they often book 100% of revenue (and thus pay 100% of taxes) at home. Read: This is the beginning of the end for this economic expansion ‘The best offense is defense’ stocks In the same vein, one sector that has seen durable returns in 2018 is the aerospace and defense industry. The iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF ITA, -2.45% is up about 8% year-to-date vs. a broader stock market that is slightly in the red. Big players like Northrop Grumman NOC, -2.31%  and Raytheon RTN, -1.59%  are both up by double digits this year and roughly 40% in the last 12 months. A more confrontational environment around the world means more focus on our military. But more importantly, in the same breath as Donald Trump tends to talk about shutting down our borders to foreign people and foreign goods, he tends to talk up the importance of a military presence to achieve this. And while Republicans don’t like big government spending in general, they never fail to come up with big bucks for military spending — as evidenced by the latest full-year federal budget deal. The defense trade is a little old, but continues to be one of the most reliable strategies to play the often chimerical Trump presidency. Read: Robert Shiller says an economic crisis looms amid the chaos brought by Trump Be wary of Chinese tech investments Tech stocks make up some of the best investments over the last few years, but savvy investors know that not all of those picks are based in the U.S. Take Alibaba BABA, -2.93% which has surged 80% or so in the last 12 months, or Tencent Holdings TCEHY, -2.58% 0700, +1.28% which has soared about 90% in the same period. With saber rattling from the Trump administration over tech-specific issues like intellectual property disputes and tighter restrictions on China-led acquisitions, there could very well be a shake-up in this already volatile corner of emerging market investing. The most obvious proof of this trend is a big decline for funds that zero in specifically on tech stocks in Asia. The Guggenheim China Technology ETF CQQQ, -2.91% plunged more than 8% last week. Heck, Chinese internet giant Baidu BIDU, -2.55%  plunged 12% or so last week. There’s a chance Chinese regulators and government officials bail out this sector. But this extreme volatility last week should clearly show the risks this sector faces. Is artificial intelligence a better stock picker than humans? Say goodbye to U.S. semiconductors Of course, a trade war creates losers on both sides. And the U.S. tech sector could be due for some pain as well, particularly in the chip-making sector. One of the “no-brainer” trades in tech over the last few years has been the continued consolidation in the semiconductor space. Not only have there been buyout premiums for the little guys, but the few remaining big players enjoy unmatched stability thanks to less competition and strong baseline demand in a world where everything from thermostats to cars to watches are now wired. Well, not anymore. The first blow came from the denial of a mammoth merger between Singapore-based Broadcom AVGO, -3.15%  and domestic chip maker Qualcomm QCOM, -3.49%  earlier this year. While some investors still held out hope that wasn’t the last word, Qualcomm stock has cratered almost 20% from the end of February as the East vs. West dynamic has gotten worse in a hurry. And despite upbeat earnings that showed a beat on the bottom line and strong guidance, Micron MU, -2.77%  tumbled roughly 8% in a single session Friday. It has admittedly been a fantastic run for chip makers, with the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXX, -3.02%  soaring roughly 120% from January 2016 to January 2018. But that trade was pretty mature a few months ago and now appears to be unwinding in a hurry on continued trade tensions. Watch multinationals for future pain While there may not be much immediate pain or a clear blow dealt to U.S. multinationals, they are among the losers because they are likely to experience the pain on both sides of the policy divide. That’s fundamentally why companies like Caterpillar CAT, -3.47% and 3M MMM, -2.94%  took last week’s trade news the hardest, with losses of about 5% and 8%, respectively. Heavy machinery made by Caterpillar uses imported materials, and needs broad demand from a robust economy. Same for 3M’s industrial chemicals. Big banks like JPMorgan Chase JPM, -2.49%  also will suffer. Most economists know a trade war is a net negative for the entire global economy — and financials companies are in many ways the foundation for economic growth. JPMorgan fell about 5% last week as a result. Interconnected blue chips don’t have the luxury of picking a side in a trade war. And though they may not be the ultimate targets, stocks like these may bear much of the pain across the coming months.

TCEHY	Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. 9984, -0.42%   is looking to invest $1 billion in a Chinese truck-hailing company backed by internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY, -2.58%   and a private-equity firm co-founded by billionaire Jack Ma, according to people familiar with the matter. The possible investment is part of a fundraising effort by Manbang Group, a tech unicorn that runs a mobile app platform matching truck drivers with shippers who have cargo to move. Unicorns are private companies that have valuations greater than $1 billion. Manbang is looking to raise between $500 million and $1 billion in fresh funds to help it expand in China’s growing logistics market, according to people familiar with the matter. Neither the fundraising amount nor the participating investors have been set, the people said. The infusion of funds would value the company at about $5 billion if Manbang raised $500 million, they said. Representatives from Manbang Group didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. A SoftBank investment would come from its Vision Fund, a nearly $100 billion investment vehicle that has backed other ride-hailing companies such as Uber Technologies Inc. and Didi Chuxing Technology Co. in China. The company spent about $8 billion for a stake of about 15% in Uber last year. SoftBank declined to comment. An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.

TCEHY	With stock market valuations so high and volatility spiking — a strange, new world for many investors — stock pickers may finally get their day in the sun again. It’ll be tough for mere index “huggers” to perform well. If that’s the case, it makes sense to study the thinking of active managers who beat the market during the dark days of the past several years, when so few of them did. Michael Lippert of the Baron Opportunity Fund BIOPX, -1.99% owned by Baron Funds, fits the bill. He outperformed his fund category by an average of 4.75 percentage points a year over the past three years and 1.74 percentage points over 10 years, according to fund-research firm Morningstar. I recently caught up with Lippert to find out more about his approach. One of the first things you notice about him is that his thinking seems well-suited for a rich market like this one. “I assume multiples are going to come down,” he says, referring to stocks’ price-to-earnings ratios. “I am not banking on making good returns on my stocks because of multiple expansion.” Instead, he favors fast-growth companies whose sales and earnings growth are so good, they will probably outrun any multiple contraction. The weighted average revenue growth of the companies in his portfolio is typically around 20% or more. Favoring growth makes sense, say market strategists at Goldman Sachs GS, -2.28% “In environments of healthy but modest economic growth, investors typically allocate a scarcity premium to firms able to generate superior growth,” Goldman chief equity strategist David Kostin recently wrote in a note to clients. Despite the rich market, the multiples on growth companies might not be so bad. “Some of the most expensive and fastest-growing S&P 500 firms also carry the least elevated multiples relative to history,” says Kostin. The Buffett holy grail Of course, rapid revenue growth doesn’t mean much for investors if that growth peters out. So Lippert also wants to own innovative companies that are disrupting some part of the economy and “leading or participating in the way the world is changing.” If they’re good at it, this gives them the Warren Buffett holy grail in investing: a durable and sustainable competitive advantage. So it’s no surprise to see that Amazon.com AMZN, -3.20% Tesla TSLA, -2.10% Netflix NFLX, -1.74% and Tencent TCEHY, -2.58% were among the biggest movers accounting for much of his outperformance during the past five years, according to an analysis by Morningstar. Facebook FB, -1.34% rounds out the top-five list here. But Lippert is actually underweight in Facebook when compared with his fund’s benchmark. That’s not because of the ongoing controversy over possible abuse of users’ personal data. “There is no amount of research that will tell us what will happen in Washington, D.C. And it is hard to know what impact that would have on users,” he says. Instead, he’s been concerned about the slowdown in user engagement in North America. While the company posted very impressive 48% ad sales growth in the fourth quarter, user time spent on the site declined by 5%. That happened because of changes in Facebook’s news feed to emphasize content from friends and family over news stories, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in the earnings call. Zuckerberg thinks the change will be good in the long term because it will increase meaningful social interaction. That might be. But I don’t have the impression that Lippert is rushing to add to his Facebook position in this weakness. Read: Why Facebook shares are ‘probably dead money’ for the rest of 2018 Instead, here’s a look at five other names from among his top holdings that he particularly likes — many of which might outperform the beloved FAANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google). Guidewire Software (TICKER:GWRE)  Business practices change slowly in the cautious world of insurance underwriting. But Guidewire has set out to change that. It sells software that helps insurance companies analyze data and process claims. Because the software is delivered from the cloud, it helps insurance companies save on IT costs. “Once a customer goes with Guidewire, the core of their business will run on its software,” says Lippert. This assures recurring revenue, assuming customers like the product. That seems to be the case. “They only lost one customer in their history and that customer came back,” says Lippert. He expects 20% plus annual revenue growth for years. He thinks the stock looks attractive, in part, because he believes Wall Street analysts underestimate the potential. Lippert is making a big bet here. This was the second-largest position in his fund at the end of the fourth quarter, accounting for 5.5% of his portfolio. Gartner (TICKER:IT)  Technology continues to evolve rapidly, so it’s hard for managers to keep up. That’s where Gartner comes in. It offers research, consulting and conferences on IT trends. “They’re helping customers in a period of disruption,” says Lippert. He thinks the company has plenty of room to expand, and this will support revenue growth of around 15% or so for many years. Gartner was recently his third-largest position, at 5.2% of his portfolio. Electronic Arts (TICKER:EA)  This video-game maker looks like a pretty big exception to Lippert’s preference for companies with fast revenue growth. Sales were up just 1% in the fourth quarter. But Lippert also favors companies where his own work suggests Wall Street analysts are underestimating the potential. He thinks that’s the case here. He says that “2018 has a good shot at being better than people think it will be.” The company is rolling out a new version of its popular Battlefront game. This is a World Cup year for soccer, which should drive a lot of interest in its FIFA game. And the Star Wars game mishap, caused by pushback on in-game sales of virtual goods, will stop weighing on year-over-year results. Plus, anticipation will build this year for a new release called Anthem, another online multiplayer action game, which the company says will come out in 2019. “Some of the things that affected them in 2017 get a lot better this year,” says Lippert. This was a much smaller position at the end of last year, at just 1.3% of the portfolio, according to Morningstar. Acxiom (TICKER:ACXM)  You may think no one notices when you use one email to log on to Facebook, and another for Amazon.com. But Acxiom probably does. Working behind the scenes, it tracks consumer activity across digital platforms, devices, and even inside brick-and-mortar stores. It compiles the data to build profiles of consumers and their habits, which it then shares with advertisers to help them with their marketing. This sounds like it harbors the potential for foul play, but Acxiom claims it has privacy policies in place that prevent abuse. As a company that is shaping the way advertisers interact with customers in the digital world, Acxiom is clearly “participating in the way the world is changing,” a checklist quality for Lippert. It was a top-20 position as of the end of the fourth quarter, representing 2% of the overall portfolio. Tesla Inc. (TICKER:TSLA)  Baron Capital has been a big fan of this electric-car maker for years, so it is no surprise to see Tesla as the fifth-largest position in Lippert’s fund, at 4.6% of the portfolio. Tesla obviously fits in as a disruptive company. It’s trying to revolutionize the auto sector by making electric cars more affordable with its Model 3. More importantly, Tesla is reshaping production by introducing more robotics and technology in its factories. “Tesla is trying to do something really hard,” says Lippert. “They are trying to make a car differently.” Therein lies the difficulty for investors, at least for the moment. The company has been pushing back target dates for Model 3 production goals, in part because of trouble with battery-pack assembly. “They had to redesign the equipment and software. They tell us they have figured it out,” says Lippert, and that it will be working at the end of March. Investors sure hope so. Tesla’s stock has practically gone nowhere since the start of last April. It could use a jolt. At the time of publication, Michael Brush had no positions in any stocks mentioned in this column. Brush has suggested AMZN, NFLX and FB in his stock newsletter, Brush Up on Stocks. Brush is a Manhattan-based financial writer who has covered business for the New York Times and The Economist group, and he attended Columbia Business School in the Knight-Bagehot program.

TCEHY	This is an updated version of an article originally published on March 21. A “trade war” is the top tail risk for financial markets, according to fund managers, who also now overwhelmingly describe the global economy as entering the “late cycle” period. “Cracks in the bull case are starting to emerge, with fund managers citing concerns over trade, stagflation and leverage,” said Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, referring to the firm’s monthly global fund managers survey released on Tuesday. “Investors have yet to act on these fears, however, as rates and earnings are keeping the bulls bullish,” he said. Stocks fell sharply on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -2.34%  dropping more than 400 points, or 1.9%, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -2.19%  dropped 1.7% as the Trump administration prepared to unveil trade restraints against China. Read: The 10 ways China could retaliate against the U.S. in a trade war A potential global trade conflict was cited as the top worry by 30% of respondents, followed by inflation at 23% and a global growth slowdown at 23% (see chart below). Trade war moved into the top spot after Trump earlier this month imposed tariffs on aluminum and steel imports and as the administration signaled further trade measures were in the offing, underlining worries over a potential tit-for-tat spiral of retaliation that could pose a threat to global growth. Trade-war fears last topped the list in January 2017 ahead of Trump’s inauguration. See: U.S. soybeans would be China’s biggest weapon in a trade war The survey was conducted between March 9-15 and included 176 participants, with a combined $514 billion in assets under management. In other findings, the poll found that 74% of investors believe the global economy is in the late cycle, the highest percentage in survey history. The survey, however, showed that despite qualms, investors remained long global stocks, banks and tech, while remaining short bonds and defensives, while cash levels fell from 4.7% to 4.6%. Meanwhile, subdued interest rates and strong earnings continued to encourage bulls, the survey found, with most expecting it to take a significant rise in Treasury yields to prompt a rotation out of stocks. When asked what 10-year Treasury yield level would incite rotation from stocks to bonds, the survey produced a weighted-midpoint of 3.6%. The 10-year yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.66% was up 3.2 basis points Tuesday at 2.875%.  Meanwhile, fund managers said long bets on FAANG+BAT were the “most crowded” trade. The acronyms refer to a combo of U.S. and Chinese tech juggernauts, with FAANG consisting of Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -3.20% Apple Inc. AAPL, -2.56% Netflix Inc. NFLX, -1.74%  and Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -2.02% BAT refers to Baidu Inc.

TCEHY	Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. (0700.HK) reported a 98% jump in fourth-quarter net profit, beating market expectations, on the back of growth in mobile gaming as well as robust social and video advertising sales. Tencent said Wednesday its net profit for the October-December period rose to 20.80 billion yuan ($3.29 billion) from CNY10.53 billion a year earlier. Analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence expected fourth-quarter net profit of CNY17.5 billion. Tencent's revenue for the period rose 51% to CNY66.39 billion from CNY43.86 billion a year ago. Its operating profit was CNY25.72 billion, up 85% from a year earlier. Shares of the Shenzhen, China-based company, which has a market capitalization of HK$4394.4 billion ($560 million), ended 0.9% lower at HK$462.6 in Hong Kong before the earnings release, putting the year's gain at 14%. The company's full-year net profit rose 74% to CNY71.51 billion, while revenue increased 56% to CNY237.76 billion. It recommended a final dividend of HK$0.88 a share, up from HK$0.61 a share it paid in the previous year.

TCEHY	"Shares in Ubisoft Entertainment SA (UBI.FR) gained Wednesday after France's Vivendi SA (VIV.FR) said it was abandoning a power struggle with the videogame maker by selling its entire stake for 2 billion euros ($2.46 billion). Vivendi, which first bought a stake in Ubisoft three years ago, said it would sell its 27.27% stake for EUR66 per share. As part of the transaction, Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK) will take 5% in the company and support Ubisoft's expansion in China, Ubisoft said. At 0836 GMT, Ubisoft shares traded 5.0% higher at EUR71.98, while Vivendi shares gained 1.7% to EUR21.76. Although the sale represents a reversal for Vivendi, it said the EUR2 billion price tag is more than double the EUR794 million it spent on building its stake over the past three years. The deal represents the end of tensions between Vivendi and Ubisoft, letting the videogame maker escape the potential takeover it has been dreading since Vivendi first bought a stake in 2015. Ubisoft has opposed Vivendi's moves to build its stake and to its taking of any board positions, saying Vivendi would destroy shareholder value. ""Ubisoft's management showed that David could beat Goliath twice in a row,"" say analysts at Bryan Garnier, referring to the hostile overtures by Electronic Arts (EA) in 2004 and Vivendi about a decade later. Bryan Garnier said the deal represented ""the only positive way forward,"" and estimated Vivendi's capital gain at EUR1.2 billion. In addition to Tencent, Ubisoft said the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan is buying a 3.4% stake in the company. ""The entry of these two high-profile investors in Ubisoft's share capital validates Ubisoft's strategy and confirms the value creation potential for its shareholders,"" Ubisoft said. The company also has agreements to sell 3 million shares to Guillemot Brothers SE, a minority shareholder, and 7.59 million shares to Ubisoft itself. The Guillemot family founded Ubisoft about three decades ago. Vivendi will no longer be a Ubisoft shareholder and agreed not to purchase any Ubisoft shares for five years. The company does, however, plan to strengthen its position in the videogame sector, it said."

TCEHY	"Chinese tech titan Tencent Holdings Ltd. reports its fourth-quarter and annual earnings after the market closes in Hong Kong on Wednesday. Here's what you need to know. EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence expect Tencent to report earnings of 17.5 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) for the three months ended Dec. 31, a 42% increase over the 12.3 billion yuan earned during the same period a year earlier. REVENUE FORECAST: Tencent's quarterly revenue is expected to reach 68.9 billion yuan, up from 43.9 billion yuan a year earlier, boosted by solid gains in paid subscriptions for video and music, along with higher levels of ad revenue. WHAT TO WATCH: WECHAT NATION: Tencent's popular social media app WeChat now has more than 1 billion users, and analysts say Tencent is starting to open up the app to more advertising. Popular mini videogame ""Tiao Yi Tiao,"" or ""Jump Jump,"" for example, started allowing McDonald's and Nike to brand the boxes that players' avatars hop onto, and gives users coupons if the avatar doesn't fall off the boxes. Meanwhile, WeChat mini programs--or mini-apps for businesses--launched in January 2017 and already have more than 400 million users. PAYING CUSTOMERS: Tencent Video reported Sunday that it now has 63 million paid subscribers, up from 43 million at the end of September. Tencent Video head Thirty Sun attributed the increase to expanded content, particularly TV series created in house. Meanwhile, Tencent Music's streaming services now have a combined market share of more than 70% in China, according to Citi Research, making it a leader in the business. But all the gains come at a high price. Tencent Video has yet to be profitable, and spending to license and make popular shows is expensive. Mr. Sun said spending on video content would increase this year. SHOPPING SPREE: During the fourth quarter, Tencent began a brick-and-mortar business buying spree, taking a stake in Chinese superstore Yonghui Superstores Ltd. It then invested in Carrefour China, Wanda Commercial Properties and Heilan Home Ltd. in January. Analysts say the move is part of Tencent's bigger Internet Plus initiative to digitize the retail business. ""We expect further investments to be made in 2018 given the intense competition in smart retailing in digitalization,"" analysts at Credit Suisse said in a research note. Tencent competitor Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has also invested heavily in this area, making new retail technologies a priority. GAME TIME: Videogames remain the top source of revenue for Tencent, and any update from company officials on new initiatives will be watched closely as revenue from top-grossing game ""Honor of Kings"" starts to decline. In late December, the company released a car racing mobile game, QQ Speed, which brought in more than 10 million users in the first 24 hours of launching. In the current quarter, Tencent has released two localized, mobile versions of the hit South Korean game ""PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds""--but has yet to begin to monetize them.

TCEHY	The iQiyi Inc. video-streaming unit of search-engine giant Baidu Inc. has filed for an initial public offering in the U.S., promoting its ability to use artificial intelligence and user data to deliver videos that generate billions of views. In a U.S. regulatory filing, Baidu BIDU, -2.55%   said it would list iQiyi on the Nasdaq exchange and is seeking to raise around $1.5 billion. Analysts at Jefferies have valued iQiyi at $17 billion. The move comes as Baidu looks to raise money for the loss-making unit to stay ahead in the fiercely competitive video-streaming sector where tech titans Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY, -2.58%   and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, -2.93%  also have strong plays. Baidu told investors in its most recent earnings call that it would remain iQiyi’s controlling shareholder. IQiyi, which was founded in 2010 and will list under the ticker IQ, said it is China’s largest video-streaming service by amount of time spent watching, with more than 50 million paid subscribers.

TCEHY	"Baidu Inc. is considering listing online-video unit iQiyi in the U.S. as a separate public company while increasing investment in its mobile and artificial intelligence. The investments, coupled with exiting parts of the business no longer deemed key to its operations, ""will sow the seed for Baidu's future growth in autonomous driving and conversational AI, particularly in the home environment,"" Chief Financial Officer Herman Yu said in a prepared statement. IQiyi, which in 2016 broke the $1 billion revenue mark and last year became the only Chinese service to license Netflix Inc. shows, competes with the likes of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.'s Youku Tudou and Tencent Holdings Ltd.'s Tencent Video. In New York trading, Baidu's American depositary receipts have outperformed the market, rising 22% over the past 12 months. Its ADRs rose 4.6% to $235.80 in after-hours trading Tuesday. As it released fourth-quarter and annual results on Tuesday, Baidu confirmed it had filed preliminary documents for an initial public offering in the U.S. If it ultimately goes through with the IPO, Baidu said it expects to remain iQiyi's controlling shareholder. Founded in 2000, Baidu built its business around online search. But as the core search business reaches maturity, Baidu has moved to make AI the centerpiece of its business plan. Baidu has pledged to deliver a self-driving bus by the end of the year and fully autonomous cars by 2021. The heavy investment comes with a price tag, however, and research and development costs reached 3.7 billion yuan ($569 million) in the most recent period, up 25% from the year earlier. Meanwhile, content costs reached 3.75 billion yuan ($577 million), up 46% from the year-ago period, with most of that increase coming from iQiyi as Baidu pushed to stay ahead in China's fiercely competitive video-streaming sector. Overall, fourth-quarter profit edged up to 4.16 billion yuan ($639 million), or 12.38 yuan an ADR. Excluding stock-based compensation and other items, profit rose to 14.90 yuan an ADR from 13.23 yuan a year earlier. Revenue rose 29% to 23.56 billion yuan ($3.62 billion), beating internal projections. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected 13.38 yuan an ADR in adjusted profit and 23.05 billion yuan in revenue. Revenue from online marketing, which contributes the bulk of Baidu's top line, rose 26% in the latest period as Baidu reported a 2% increase in the number of active online marketing customers and continued to squeeze more money from each advertiser. Meanwhile, Baidu's other service revenue, which is typically driven by iQiyi subscription services, surged 53% to 3.14 billion yuan. For the current quarter, Baidu expects 19.86 billion yuan to 20.97 billion yuan in revenue ($3.05 billion to $3.22 billion), compared with analysts' estimates of 21.18 billion yuan.

TCEHY	The AMG Managers Pictet International Fund typically doesn’t follow its rivals into high-flying stocks, opting instead for deep research to uncover what often turn out to be “idiosyncratic” companies, said Ben Beneche, the fund’s co-portfolio manager. Coverage of investing outside the U.S. usually is focused on emerging markets, especially China, as Alibaba BABA, -2.93% Tencent TCEHY, -2.58%  and Baidu BIDU, -2.55% enjoy rapid growth as the government supports their virtual monopolies. But you won’t find those names among the top holdings of the AMG Managers Pictet International Fund APINX, -0.72% Beneche and co-managers Fabio Paolini and Swee-Kheng Lee favor companies including British medical-device maker LivaNova PLC LIVN, -1.31% Switzerland-based food company Nestle SA NESN, +0.48% and Japan Tobacco Inc. 2914, +0.30% Nine of the mutual fund’s top 10 holdings have posted gains over the past three years, the sole exception being Anheuser-Busch InBev SA ABI, -1.10% “We do not think we have an edge in terms of predicting the cycle of future political events. We have an edge in playing the long-term game of buying attractive companies at attractive prices,” said Paolini, who heads the AMG Pictet International funds’ strategy. Read: This stock might be your best bargain investment in China’s growth Beneche said the fund’s management team is being “extremely selective in order not to be caught by severe [price-to-earnings valuation] multiple contraction or earnings contraction.” Concern over inflated valuations is no doubt weighing heavily on U.S. investors weathering a sustained selloff for stocks. One area Beneche believes has gotten frothy is semiconductors, which is backed up by this chart showing the five-year performance of the S&P 500 semiconductors subsector against the S&P 500 Index SPX, -2.19% : FactSet The S&P 500 semiconductors subsector has more than doubled the return of the broader index over the past five years. It has been an incredible five-year ride for semiconductors, as investors expect the industry to stay on a rapid growth path because of the internet of things — the trend for consumer devices and home appliances to be connected to the internet. But Paolini says many stocks in the industry are now overpriced. “It is fair to say we are seeing signs of high margins and unsustainable levels of profitability in some elements of the semiconductor supply chain,” he said. Still, the fund has some exposure to semiconductors, including ASML Holding N.V. ASML, -1.71% its ninth-largest position as of Dec. 31. AMG Funds Fabio Paolini, senior investment manager, AMG Managers Pictet International Fund. Three stock picks in Japan, South Korea and France Beneche described Cocokara Fine Inc. 3098, +0.40%  as “one of the long-term winners” as Japan’s pharmacy market consolidates. Unlike in the U.S., where two drugstore chains dominate the pharmacy space, the top 10 chain companies in Japan make up about 40% of the market. Cocokara Fine “is the product of a six-way merger that continues to consolidate that market,” Beneche said. He predicts cost savings from the merger will allow the company to earn “reasonable” returns. The shares trade for between 13 and 14 times what he believes the company’s “normal level of profitability” will be, which puts the valuation at about half the level of its competitors. That “normal” level of earnings power will be achieved within the next 12 to 24 months, he said. AMG Funds Ben Beneche, co-portfolio manager, AMG Managers Pictet International Fund. While the fund is primarily invested in developed markets, it has up to 10% exposure in emerging markets, which include South Korea, because of the nature of corporate governance in the country, with families that have relatively little economic interest in companies controlling them through special classes of voting shares, Beneche explained. South Korea’s Hyundai Mobis Co. 012330, -0.76%  makes auto parts for Hyundai Motor Co. 005380, -0.98% HYMLF, -11.11% Paolini said shares of Hyundai Mobis have been under pressure because of the troubled relationships between North and South Korea, as well as China, “where there is a huge amount of anti-Korea sentiment.” Hyundai Motor sales to China have fallen 40% over the past year, he said. As a “captive business,” selling parts to Hyundai Motor, there is an “instant impact” to Hyundai Mobis when demand for vehicles declines, Paolini said. But over the long term, he expects the “highly predictable cash-generating business” to support considerably higher valuations for the shares. Paolini cited French aircraft-engine maker Safran SA SAF, +0.30% SAFRY, +0.21%  as an attractive long-term play. What Paolini likes about the business is not the initial sales, but the “fantastic visibility” of the revenue generated trough maintenance contracts that run for as long as 25 years. Safran has a dominant position in the market for engines for narrow-body passenger jet planes, and Paolini sees no end to its order backlog or the flow of revenue and earnings gravy from overhauls and maintenance of engines.

It has $2.1 billion in assets and a five-star rating, the highest, from fund-research company Morningstar.

TCEHY	Ctrip.com Ltd. has a virtual monopoly in China’s online travel space, and recent pressure on the shares springing from a regulatory action has set up a buying opportunity for long-term investors, according to Di Zhou, a co-portfolio manager for the Thornburg International Value Fund. Consider this two-year chart for Ctrip.com CTRP, -2.33% : FactSet The stock closed at $46.78 on Jan. 31, up from its closing low of $43.16 on Dec. 11 but down substantially from its closing high of $58.73 on July 31. What has spooked investors is a regulatory requirement for Ctrip to change its website so that the default setting is for customers to opt-out of various add-on services. During the company’s second-quarter earnings call, Ctrip CFO Cindy Xiaofan Wang said the change would have a “negative impact on the revenues for our air ticketing business” in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter. “They have margin pressure this quarter and next quarter but fundamentally Ctrip is best positioned to grow,” among large internet companies in China, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, -2.93% Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY, -2.58%  and Baidu Inc. BIDU, -2.55% Zhou said in an interview last week. Read: This China-focused fund beats its rivals by looking beyond Alibaba and Tencent How to invest like Warren Buffett “You can argue China is almost near full online penetration,” Zhou said, adding that the story is different for Ctrip because online travel is still limited for Chinese consumers. “You still have a penetration story that is going to be your tailwind for a long time,” she said,” noting that Ctrip is similar to Alibaba in that it has been able to eliminate all of its competition in China, in part because of “regulatory protection.” Thornburg Investment Management Di Zhou, co-portfolio manager on the Thornburg International Value Fund. Zhou expects the “near-term margin reset” to be only a temporary setback for the stock because of the company’s long-term growth potential and the necessity of some of the add-on services. “The trip delay insurance is popular because of all the delays in China,” she said. Ctrip reported a 42% year-over-year increase in third-quarter sales, with its gross margin improving to 83% from 78% a year earlier, while its operating margin improved to 17% from 8%. The company has not announced when it will report fourth-quarter results, but FactSet expects the announcement on Feb. 20.

Zhou stressed how much data there is for companies (and the government) in China to gather, given China’s population of 1.4 billion. “All the e-commerce transaction data is on Alibaba’s platform; the information data, surge, map, location, online-to-offline [data ]are largely on Baidu’s platform. The social networking data is largely on Tencent’s platform,” she said. The Thornburg International Value Fund has positions in Alibaba and Tencent but not in Baidu, as the stock’s valuation to earnings has gotten too high, Zhou said. Zhou said that initial public offerings are important for investors who wish to participate in China, and named Qudian Inc. QD, -4.95%  as an example, although the micro lender isn’t held by the fund. Quidian completed its IPO in October. The company is partially owned by Ant Financial (currently a unit of Alibaba), which Zhou expects to be publicly listed on its own “pretty soon.” China doesn’t have a credit-card or unsecured consumer-lending environment similar to the one in the U.S., but the country’s mobile payment volume in 2016 was $11 billion — 16 times as large as volume in the U.S., Zhou said. Ant Financial runs Alibaba’s Alipay service, which has the highest market penetration for mobile payments in China. So Alibaba’s shareholders may be looking at an excellent opportunity for further gains if and when Ant Financial is spun-off.

TCEHY	Billionaire Wang Jianlin's Dalian Wanda Group is selling shares worth 7.8 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) in his Chinese movie-theater chain to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and a firm partly backed by the government as he seeks to pay down debt at his flagship company. Wanda Film owns and operates about 500 theaters and 4,000 screens on the mainland. The investment could open the door to future partnerships between Alibaba and Wanda's other showbiz units, such as Hollywood production company Legendary Entertainment, and may expand the e-commerce company's data bank through access to Wanda's film-goers and their customer data. Wanda is now in business with China's two largest internet giants as it moves to shore up its balance sheet. The company struck an agreement in late January to sell a 34-billion-yuan stake in its property business, which mainly comprises shopping malls, to a group that included Chinese social-media titan Tencent Holdings Ltd. Last year, Wanda came under fire from Beijing for its aggressive overseas deal-making, which curtailed the company's ability to pay for overseas acquisitions and repay debt. The company since has sold billions of dollars in assets both in China and abroad. In a regulatory filing Monday, Mr. Wang's publicly listed cinema unit, Wanda Film Holding Co., said it would sell a combined 12% stake to Alibaba and Cultural Investment Holdings Co., a film company partly owned by the Beijing municipal government. Alibaba will buy a 7.7% stake in Wanda Film for about 4.7 billion yuan, while Cultural Investment will take a stake of about 5% for 3.1 billion yuan, Wanda Film said. Wanda Film said the deal with Alibaba was signed to strengthen their partnership in movie distribution, film investment, advertising and online ticket sales. Alibaba's forays into entertainment has lagged Chinese rivals Tencent Holdings and Baidu Inc. Alibaba's film-production and digital-entertainment units also operate at a loss. Trading in Wanda Film, which is listed on the Shenzhen stock exchange, has been suspended for almost half a year after its shares plummeted by nearly 10% on online speculation that lenders had issued a notice to unload bonds tied to its parent company. Dalian Wanda dismissed the rumors. For Dalian Wanda, the investment could help usher its bricks-and-mortar theater operations into the digital era amid slowing growth at the box office. Movie-ticket sales in the world's second-largest economy grew 14% last year to 55.9 billion yuan, the country's media regulator said, which was slower than an average growth rate of 34% between 2011 and 2015. Industry insiders say the rise of video-streaming in China now competes for consumers' time and money.

TCEHY	"(Adds updates throughout.) Shares of AstraZeneca PLC (AZN.LN) reversed a morning fall after the company announced partnerships with two Chinese heavyweights, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, -2.93% and Tencent Holdings Ltd., TCEHY, -2.58% alongside its fourth-quarter earnings. The Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company said it will work with Alibaba subsidiary Ali Health, using technologies such as artificial intelligence to help with patient diagnosis and treatment. The company said a major area of collaboration will be traceable codes on drugs that will give consumers more information about the medicine they use. In the second partnership, AstraZeneca will collaborate with Tencent to combat the online sale of counterfeit drugs. The announcement of the partnerships coincides with U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May's state visit to China. Shares had fallen in morning trade after the pharmaceutical company said pretax profit decreased 81% in the fourth quarter to $407 million, from $2.18 billion the year before. It missed analyst expectations of $552 million pretax profit. AstraZeneca said revenue increased to $5.78 billion, up 3.4% on the previous-year period. Product sales in the fourth quarter came to $5.49 billion compared with $5.26 billion the year before, AstraZeneca said. It guided for a low single-digit percentage increase in product sales for 2018. The company said selling, general and administrative costs in the period more-than doubled to $3.08 billion. AstraZeneca said it is guiding for core earnings per share in the range of $3.30 to $3.50, down from its 2017 core EPS figure of $4.28. Berenberg said the core EPS guidance is 3% below expectations at the mid-point. The company declared a second interim dividend of $1.90, bringing its full-year dividend to $2.80, unchanged from the year before. AstraZeneca said it expects core research-and-development costs to either experience a low single-digit decline or remain unchanged. ""AstraZeneca's revenues improved over the course of the year, a sign of how our company is steadily turning a corner. Strong commercial execution helped us bring our science to more patients, making the most of our exciting pipeline,"" Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said. Mr. Soriot said the company had performed well in China, where product sales increased 30% on a constant exchange-rate basis in the fourth quarter. Shares of AstraZeneca at 1446 GMT were up 91 pence, or 1.9%, to 4978.50 pence, after having fallen as much as 2.9% earlier in the day.

TCEHY	French retailer Carrefour SA (CA.FR) on Tuesday announced a sweeping reorganization including job reductions and potential store closures aimed at shoring up its faltering performance. The company plans to offer 2,400 employees voluntary redundancies and to divest 273 ex-Dia stores. It has also made agreements for new partnerships that it expects will strengthen its e-commerce, last-mile delivery and Chinese operations. Carrefour last week cut its earnings outlook as it continues to struggle with sluggish domestic performance, challenges outside France and tough digital competition. Carrefour will offer about 2,400 employees a voluntary-redundancy package at its headquarters in the Ile-de-France region. As part of this, Carrefour will close its Boulogne headquarters and scrap plans to build new headquarters in Essone. The company currently employs 10,500 people at its head office. If it doesn't find a buyer for the 273 former Dia stores it plans to divest, they will be closed. Carrefour also announced a strategic cooperation agreement with Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK) in China, as well as a potential investment by both Tencent and Yonghui Superstores Co. Ltd (601933.SH).

TCEHY	You don’t have to speak lots of languages and spend several months a year globetrotting to be an international investing star. But it surely doesn’t hurt. Just consider the case of Danton Goei, who manages the Davis Global Fund DGFAX, -1.53% Goei was born on a military base in Germany, and he grew up in France. He speaks French and Mandarin. Goei got his MBA from the Wharton School, and he now lives in New York City. But he spends lots of time meeting with companies abroad. So the language skills come in handy. “I get to conduct a fair amount of meetings in Chinese,” says Goei. “It’s helpful because even if the CFO speaks English, the CEO may not. And one or two levels below, they don’t.” Eight of his top 20 holdings do business in China, and they’ve helped Goei beat his competitors by a long shot. Along with large positions in Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -2.02% GOOGL, -2.20% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -3.20% exposure to China plays like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, -2.93%  and Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY, -2.58% have helped Goei beat his benchmark by 5.2 percentage points annualized over the past five years, according to Morningstar. He bests the Morgan Stanley Capital International All Country World Index Ex-U.S. by 9.1 percentage points over the last five years. This index is tracked by the iShares MSCI ACW ETF ACWI, -1.67%  exchange traded fund. That’s impressive performance. While I may never learn Mandarin, I suspect I can learn a thing or two about investing from someone with such a great record. So I recently chatted with Goei to find out what he does that gives him an edge. I also got the run down on some of his favorite positions, which appear attractive around current levels. Here are three key investing rules, and five stocks from this star manager. Rule No. 1: Run a concentrated portfolio Using diversification to reduce risk is almost a cliché in investing. But like Warren Buffett and so many of the managers I talk with who consistently outperform, Goei likes to run a fairly concentrated portfolio. This helps explain his outperformance. While the diversifiers strive to own 80 to 120 names at all times, or roughly 1% positions, Goei holds fewer than 50, and many of them are pretty concentrated. His holdings in Alphabet, Amazon.com, Wells Fargo & Co., Naspers Ltd. NPSNY, -3.84%  , Capital One Financial Co. COF, -2.87%  and Hollysys Automation Technologies Ltd. HOLI, -1.87% are all 4% or greater positions. “It’s a high conviction approach, with a lot of due diligence up front,” says Goei. Rule No. 2: Hold for the long run “If you can identify companies that are in good long-term positions and get to know management very well and just hold on to them, it works out great,” says Goei. “It’s an old-school approach.” Rule No. 3: Look for “compounding machines” What gives a company a “great long-term position”? Goei likes to see compounding machines. The starting point here is that, like Buffett, Goei favors companies with moats and a competitive advantage. “Capitalism is very efficient. If you have great margins, it will be taken away from you.” Coupled with this, he wants to see good reinvestment opportunities. “When we meet management, we spend a lot of time talking about where they have investment opportunities. If you own a company for five weeks, it doesn’t matter. But if you own it for five years, it makes all the difference.” A key quantitative signal that a company has a moat and a good reinvestment track record: a high return on invested capital. Goei also likes to see companies with big potential markets, in part, because they are a play on a mega-trend. Let’s take a look at three examples of big trends Goei currently invests in, and five companies that are attractive around current levels because they benefit from the trends. Mega-trend No. 1: The rise of the online consumer in China There’s no Facebook Inc. FB, -1.34% in China. Tencent has filled the gap as the main social media and messaging platform. It’s also in video games, and it has developed a huge online payment system called WeChat Pay. “Tencent has a great management team. They are very innovative,” says Goei. He has a clever way to get exposure to Tencent at a discount. He does this by owning a South African media company called Naspers. It owns a lot of Tencent shares. Naspers’ Tencent position is worth about $38 billion more than Naspers’ recent market value of around $115 billion. Besides the Tencent position, Naspers has a large satellite video distribution business in South Africa, and an online classified business in Brazil, India and Russia. Naspers also owns 15% of a private company vying to be the Amazon.com of India, called Flipkart. “You are getting all of this absolutely free,” says Goei. Mega-trend No. 2: The rise of the global middle class When people get more money, one of the first things they love to do is travel. So a key trend Goei is positioned for is the rise of global travel — linked to the rise of the middle class as GDP per capita continues to increase around the globe. A big position here is a French company called Safran SA SAFRY, +0.21% It makes jet engines in a partnership with General Electric Co. GE, -2.76% This is a complicated business, so it’s tough to break into it. Plus there are only two other players in the space beyond Safran-General Electric. They are Pratt & Whitney, owned by United Technologies Corp. UTX, -2.39% which Goei also holds, and Rolls Royce (no position). In short, price wars are rare, because of this oligopoly. Safran-General Electric supplies 75% of the demand for engines on narrow body jets like the Boeing 737, the work horse of the industry. Safran’s business also has a moat because after its engines are on a plane, Safran gets a stream of service and parts revenue for about two decades. Both Safran and Pratt & Whitney are rolling out more fuel efficient jet engines. New engine roll-outs hurt profitability initially, because it takes a while for the parts and service revenue to ramp up. “But if you put your long-term hat on like we do, then you can see it’s great,” says Goei. Another play on the rise of global travel is InterGlobe Aviation EQINDIGO, +0.11% which serves India. There’s huge pent-up demand for air travel in India because the country has 1.3 billion people, but only 440 aircraft. InterGlobe Aviation, which Goei describes as a well-run, low-cost carrier, has a 42% market share. But it is poised to grow nicely, since it has orders for 400 aircraft. InterGlobe Aviation’s competitors may be in a bind, because aircraft suppliers Boeing Co. BA, -3.06%  and Airbus SE EADSY, -0.57%  are booked for years. “If you have the orders in place and you know the competition will have to wait a long time to get their hands on aircraft, you can grow your market share,” says Goei. Mega-trend No. 3: The rise of the robots in China As China’s economy continues to develop, labor costs are rising at double-digit rates. To offset this, industry is turning to automation. As a play on this trend Goei likes Hollysys Automation Technologies Ltd. Besides the big-picture trend at work, Hollysys Automation has another advantage. It’s got the blessing of the Chinese government, which contracts Hollysys to supply control systems for railways and nuclear power plants. “Long term, the deck is stacked in their favor. They have the government on their side,” says Goei. Sectors to avoid A key part of the Davis Global Fund’s success is knowing what to avoid, says Goei. At the top of his “don’t go there” list are the “dividend darlings,” such as consumer-staples companies Coca-Cola Co. KO, -1.08%  and Procter & Gamble Co. PG, -0.47% “They are great companies. But they are expensive because everyone is stretching for yield now.” He puts utilities, energy sector master limited partnerships and real estate investment trusts in the same category. “You shouldn’t buy something just because it pays a 3% dividend yield, especially if it has a high multiple,” cautions Goei. A big problem here is that, like bonds, bond-like stocks tend to weaken when interest rates rise. So if inflation really does materialize, forcing the Federal Reserve to more aggressively hike rates, the shares of the “dividend darlings” won’t be anyone’s darling anymore.

TCEHY	"The Hang Seng Index set a record closing high Tuesday, capping a surge that put Hong Kong stocks among the world's best performers in 2017. The benchmark rose 1.8% to 31904.75, to top the previous high set on Oct. 30, 2007, just a few weeks after the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 peaked ahead of the global financial crisis. The Hang Seng, which includes HSBC Holdings PLC and Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd., was the latest global benchmark to top a previous record in the past year. After skidding into the end of 2016 due to worries about a U.S. trade war with China, Hong Kong stocks in 2017 rose in part due to improved earnings from Tencent and insurer AIA Group Ltd. Equities also benefited from an influx of mainland Chinese money that came from the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect. But lingering worries about China's economy kept most foreign investors out of Hong Kong stocks last year, said Joshua Crabb, head of Asian equities at Old Mutual Global Investors. The Hang Seng rose 36% in 2017. ""It was only a year and a half ago that people thought China was going to explode,"" he added. Following a banner 2017, some fund managers and analysts say headwinds are approaching. ""We may see some kind of pullback, maybe after Chinese New Year,"" said Arthur Kwong, head of Asia-Pacific equities at BNP Paribas Investment Partners. Mr. Crabb said fears about the Chinese banks kept many global fund managers away from that sector, which accounts for nearly 20% of the Hang Seng's composition. But easing concerns about the health of corporate China may bring a rally in the year ahead, he added. The sector has started 2018 strongly, with China Construction Bank Corp. climbing 12.5% this month to approach its highest point since 2010. Mr. Kwong of BNP Paribas isn't alone in expressing near-term caution. Citi expects the Hang Seng will fall to 29500 by the end of this year, about 7.5% lower than where it is now, as most anticipated earnings improvement has been priced in. Meanwhile, Hong Kong stocks look ""somewhat on the pricey side,"" said Johan Jooste, chief investment officer at Bank of Singapore, in a news conference last week. The Hang Seng trades with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 13.4, according to data from FactSet. That is far lower than the 21.9 multiple it reached at its October 2007 peak, and relatively low compared with the S&P 500's 18.6. However, the Hang Seng figure is depressed by single-digit multiples for certain stocks, especially Chinese banks. China Construction, the fourth-largest component in the Hang Seng, trades just 6 times projected earnings for the next year, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. In comparison, Tencent has a price-to-earnings ratio of 41.8.

TCEHY	Netflix is a much-loved stock on Wall Street, and for good reason. It’s one of the FAANG stocks that has captivated investors with its momentum — a leap of more than 1,400% since the beginning of 2013. But Netflix NFLX, -1.74% isn’t bulletproof, and 2018 may be the year this stock suffers some serious damage. Sure, it has regularly obliterated the returns of the S&P 500 index SPX, -2.19%  as well as other large-cap tech stocks. And sure, investors who have naysaid the run because the stock is “overvalued” have been proven wrong time and again. But a closer examination of Netflix in 2018 reveals a much different company than just a few years ago. And worse, it shows Netflix lacks the advantages of the other FAANG stocks: Facebook FB, -1.34% Amazon.com AMZN, -3.20% Apple AAPL, -2.56%  and Google parent GOOG, -2.02% GOOGL, -2.20% It’s indeed hard to argue against Big Tech right now, and I expect these dominant megacaps to keep thriving. But the reality is that Netflix shouldn’t be included in that group — and that poses a big risk to stockholders and Wall Street puts increasingly higher expectations. Here’s why I see trouble for Netflix’s stock in 2018. Netflix is big, but not big enough For starters, let’s look at how the other FAANGs differ, and you’ll quickly see why Netflix faces threats that the others simply don’t have to worry about. • Each of these other FAANG megacaps are north of $500 billion in market value; Netflix is still under $100 billion. ­• The others each generate over $10 billion in net operating cash flow annually while Netflix can’t even break even. • The others have at least $25 billion in cash in the bank, while Netflix had less than $2 billion as of last quarter. Disney to charge 'substantially' less than Netflix for streaming I’m not saying Netflix is some fledgling business doomed to fail. But if you think it has the same scale and security as these other companies, you’re fooling yourself. Furthermore, the very nature of the Netflix model lacks the wide moat we see for the other FAANG stocks. As Peter Thiel famously said, “competition is for losers” in Silicon Valley — and Netflix clearly has the shallowest moat among the FAANGs given that dozens of streaming video companies are seeing success. Just a few instances of very real competition to Netflix include Amazon (which just won “best comedy series” at the Golden Globes), Walt Disney Co. DIS, -1.72%  (as it launches a much-anticipated over-the-top service that mashes up its huge library of content) and international threats such as China’s Tencent TCEHY, -2.58% 0700, +1.33% (which has 43 million subscribers overseas and counting). Each of these companies has both the know-how and the capital to pose serious headaches for Netflix. Reed Hastings may like to joke that the biggest competitor to Netflix is sleep, but investors better hope he’s taking real-world risks to the business quite seriously. And investors better think twice before thinking Netflix is a tech firm with deep enough pockets to weather setbacks the same as the big guys. Little room for error Of course, Netflix has continued to grow even amid competition. Higher-than-expected subscriber numbers reported in October were the best in its history and lifted the stock to a new high. TimeNetflix Inc.May 17Jul 17Sep 17Nov 17Jan 18Mar 18 US:NFLX $150 $200 $250 $300 The bulls feel justified in this continued share appreciation. However, keep in mind that the current share price isn’t a validation of October’s growth but reflect expectations about expansion. And that leaves little room for error this year. After all, the company doubled down on that trend with a forecast of 6.3 million additional subscribers in the fourth quarter on hopes that second seasons of “Stranger Things” and “The Crown” brought in move viewers. But it better have similarly enticing offerings in 2018 to keep that train running. Netflix is trying to protect its margins with a $1 monthly price increase to $10.99 for over 50 million U.S. subscribers at the end of 2017. The company has made clear that the move is not the last, either, as it needs more cash for more programming spend. Read: Which technology in Netflix’s “Black Mirror” will change our lives first? It’s worth wondering how many price increases the company can get away with, particularly in light of competing services. But it simply has to charge more to offset content costs as well as international expansion despite a lack of profitability abroad. The hope is that by reaching scale the company will eventually see a return on its investment, in typical tech-stock style. But Wall Street will eventually expect it to deliver. There are a lot of pieces to that puzzle. And while Netflix delivered in third-quarter numbers back in October, investors don’t award points for past performance. Any earnings miss on any of these fronts in 2018 will be greeted with some serious backlash. Netflix is more Under Armour than Amazon Now, let’s talk about the boogeyman of valuation — a sticky subject with stocks like Netflix, but one worth addressing. Right now, the stock has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 100 and a trailing price-to-earnings of about 200. For the record, I don’t think a valuation reading this high is categorically a bad thing. But I do think it needs to be justified — and in the case of Netflix, it isn’t. Between the amazing run for quasi-nonprofit Amazon and the general uptick in valuations across the entire market over the last several years, it’s easy to just shrug and say a high P/E doesn’t mean what it used to. But there are plenty instances when fast-growing companies imploded after being bid up too far. And one of the most telling examples for Netflix investors, I think, is the recent turmoil at Under Armour UA, -2.90% That stock increased roughly 10-fold from 2009 through 2015 as investors kept bidding the stock higher. Forward price-to-earnings ratios regularly topping 50 and trailing ratios hovering around 100 at times. At least they were until the momentum slowed. And after Under Armour reported its first-ever sales drop a few months ago, the stock hit a low of under $12 — a fraction of its highs above $100 a share. Finding the Perfect Product to Sell on Amazon Look, Amazon is allowed to trade for a nosebleed price-to-earnings ratio and operate at razor-thin margins because its scale is simply staggering and it’s nigh impossible for any competitor to knock it off its perch. It makes $40 billion in revenue each quarter — 10 times what Netflix does — and has grown aggressively into different areas via acquisitions like Audible audiobooks and Zappos shoes, or product launches like its Alexa voice assistant. But Under Armour was just an apparel company. It had a good brand and a good record, yes, and was able to see organic growth for quite a while. Ultimately, when changes in competition and consumer taste caused headwinds, there wasn’t a new growth path to fall back on… and things fell apart. Sound familiar? I’m not saying Netflix will necessarily tank in two weeks after earnings. And I’m not saying investors should prep for a 90% peak-to-trough drop in 2018 as subscribers leave in droves. But history has given us plenty of examples where a stock faces incredible expectations despite rather obvious outside risks. After all, Under Armour is still a much bigger company from a revenue perspective compared with where it was back in 2014; its top line has soared from just over $3 billion in fiscal 2014 to a projected $5 billion or so last year. Too bad its stock crashed and burned despite this. Keep this in mind. Netflix is more like Under Armor and less Amazon, and Wall Street is sure to treat it the same way at the first clear signs of trouble.

TCEHY	At the annual Neural Information Processing Systems conference in Long Beach, Calif., last week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang surprised attendees and media with the announcement of a new graphics card targeted at artificial-intelligence and machine-learning developers. The Nvidia NVDA, -3.22%  Titan V might look like a traditional graphics card used for gaming, but under the hood this new product offers a different level and type of performance. The Titan V is using the Nvidia Volta architecture, previously available only in server-based designs. The card is priced at $3,000, and while exceptionally high for an add-in card for a PC, the target audience for this is developers of upcoming machine-learning applications who need the flexibility to design on their own computers and may not have the money or resources to dedicate to a large-scale server design. Follow the leader Nvidia has built a significant lead in the high-performance compute areas of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). These are the workloads that are required for neural network processing, and are used for all kinds of tasks we use today and will expand into the future. If you have benefited from facial recognition in your Google GOOG, -2.02%  Photos library or used a portrait mode photo feature on a smartphone with a single camera lens, then you are taking advantage of machine learning. Current driver-assist features like Auto Pilot on Teslas TSLA, -2.10% and any autonomous driving options from Google and others use machine learning to build the intelligent systems that allow that to work. Nvidia’s Titan V graphics card Machine learning and artificial intelligence make up the fastest growing part of Nvidia’s portfolio. In its latest quarterly announcement, it talked about adoption of its Volta architecture in the data center for Alibaba BABA, -2.93% Baidu BIDU, -2.55% and Tencent TCEHY, -2.58% This is in addition to companies already using Nvidia hardware for artificial intelligence like Amazon AMZN, -3.20% Google, Facebook FB, -1.34% and Microsoft MSFT, -2.33% Outreach to developers While the architecture and hardware advantage that Nvidia created is a big part of why it has become the machine-learning leader, it all started with outreach to developers and educational programs around general-purpose GPU computing and the custom CUDA programming model. By offering graphics chips based computing options (other than gaming and rendering) earlier than any other technology company, Nvidia has monopolized the attention and developer cycles to create a daunting wall for any other AI company to overcome. The release of the Titan V card continues that trend, offering to the companies the best-performance graphics chip for AI and ML at a reasonable cost and making it available publicly. This gives start-up companies and individual developers the ability to use Nvidia hardware during software creation and design, which then creates familiarity with the platform that is maintained during large-scale rollouts of any implementation. Nvidia is breeding an army of developers who have grown up on its software and hardware that will help maintain a stronghold in this quickly scaling segment. AMD and Intel Nvidia is a confident company, but even Huang understands that it needs to maintain the ground-level support to fend off any other competitors in the space. AMD AMD, -4.09%  has recently made moves into the data center with its Vega architecture, and Intel INTC, -3.16%   launched Nervana earlier this fall. Intel also recently hired AMD graphics chip leader Raja Koduri to build its own discrete graphics chips from the ground up. The Nvidia Titan V uses the company’s latest graphics architecture called Volta, which is significantly different than previous designs. Volta is clearly focused on AI and ML workloads rather than gaming, even though it will be able to handle that task decently. Volta implements a new core called a Tensor Core that is custom made for the deep-learning tasks that make up artificial intelligence. Google also uses Tensor Cores in its custom-built TPU (Tensor Processing Unit), announced last year. The memory subsystem on Volta is also drastically different, using a second-generation high-bandwidth memory implementation that offers a significant increase in bandwidth that is necessary for large AI and machine-learning data sets. Adopting a custom core design not based on traditional graphics chips indicates that Nvidia is all-in on the machine-learning road map and is willing to adapt as workloads and algorithms change. It also tells us that Nvidia may be moving to a dual road map, with different chips built for machine learning and traditional gaming and rendering product segments. If true, this could prove to be a big hit to a company like AMD that doesn’t have the resources to fund R&D for two similarly significant projects.

TCEHY	"HONG KONG--Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. said third-quarter net profit rose nearly 70% from a year earlier, driven by advertising revenue gains and strong growth at its mobile-gaming and digital-content divisions. Tencent's shares have been on a tear this year, doubling its market capitalization to almost $475 billion. It has raised its international profile with a number of recent acquisitions as well, including buying Epic Games Inc. and a majority stake in electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc. And last week, Tencent bought a 12% stake in Los Angeles-based social media company Snap Inc. The company, which is based in the southern tech boomtown of Shenzhen, said its earnings for the quarter rose to more than 18 billion yuan ($2.7 billion) from about 10.6 billion yuan a year earlier. Analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence expected a profit of 15.7 billion yuan. Tencent also beat revenue expectations. The bulk of Tencent's revenue comes from online gaming. For the quarter, online games revenue rose 48% from a year earlier to 26.8 billion yuan. The company had at least four of the 10 highest-grossing games in Apple Inc.'s app store during the quarter, according to App Annie and Citi Research. Last week, Tencent's online publishing unit, China Literature Ltd., surged 86% in its Hong Kong trading debut after raising about $1.1 billion in an initial public offering. And on Thursday, Yixin Group Ltd., China's largest online auto retailing platform, will go public; Tencent owns 24% of that company. Demand was high during Yixin's bookbuilding period. Founded in 1998, Tencent is one of three major internet firms in China, along with e-commerce titan Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and search company Baidu Inc. Tencent is the largest videogame publisher in the world by revenue, but it is best known in China for its WeChat and QQ messaging and mobile-payment apps, which are installed on nearly every PC and smartphone. The combined monthly active users for Tencent's Weixin and WeChat app reached 980 million at the end of September, up 16% from a year earlier, the company said in a statement. Tencent shares ended 1.3% lower Wednesday in Hong Kong at 383 Hong Kong dollars. Alyssa Abkowitz contributed to this article.

TCEHY	Tencent Holdings Ltd. (0700.HK) reported a 69% increase in third-quarter net profit, driven by strong growth in its mobile-gaming and digital-content divisions and robust advertising revenue. The Chinese internet giant said Wednesday its net profit for the July-September period rose to 18.01 billion yuan ($2.71 billion) from CNY10.65 billion a year earlier. Analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence expected net profit of CNY15.7 billion. Tencent's revenue for the period rose 61% to CNY65.21 billion, beating analysts' forecast for CNY61 billion.

TCEHY	"Chinese gaming and social-media giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. reports its third-quarter earnings after the market closes in Hong Kong on Wednesday. Here's what you need to know. EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence expect Tencent to report earnings of 15.7 billion yuan ($2.36 billion), a 48% increase over the 10.6 billion yuan earned during the same period last year. Tencent hasn't provided earnings guidance. REVENUE FORECAST: Tencent's quarterly revenue is expected to reach 61 billion yuan, up from 40.4 billion yuan a year earlier, boosted by strong mobile-gaming revenues, increased ad sales and mobile-payment growth. WHAT TO WATCH: GAME ON: The bulk of Tencent's earnings still comes from online gaming, and the company's mobile games continue to dominate the domestic market. Tencent had five out of the top 10 grossing games in Apple's app store in China in July, and four of the top 10 in August and September, according to App Annie and Citi Research. Citi analysts expect smartphone-game revenue to jump 61% from a year earlier to 15.9 billion yuan. Analysts say Tencent's pipeline remains strong, with several new mobile games currently in beta testing, and are watching for the imminent U.S. debut of ""Arena of Valor,"" adapted from its Chinese hit game ""Honor of Kings."" AD IT UP: Ad sales on Tencent's platforms, including on its WeChat social network, are likely to have risen 45% over the past year to 10.8 billion yuan, according to Credit Suisse estimates. Tencent has introduced advertising to its platforms gradually to avoid irritating users with a sudden barrage, but analysts expect ads to generate more earnings in the future. Last week, Tencent said it would be increasing ads on its Tencent News and Tencent Video platforms. In September, Tencent launched shopping accounts on QQ, one of its social media platforms, where subscribers can follow e-commerce companies and brands to receive promotions once every four days. PAY PER VIEW: Tencent is locked in fierce competition with rivals Baidu Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. over video streaming, and is spending heavily on content to woo more users. Last week, the company's video unit previewed more than 200 new shows and movies for 2018. Analysts are looking for an increase in video-subscription revenues after the company purchased big hits during the fiscal third quarter, and Tencent Video recently surpassed Baidu's iQiyi in terms of mobile monthly active users, according to QuestMobile. Tencent Video had 43 million paid subscribers at the end of September, more than doubling from 20 million in November 2016. FINANCIAL FORAYS: Tencent's mobile-payment service, WeChat Pay, now has a 39% market share in China, up from 32% a year ago, closing in on Alibaba-backed Alipay's 54% market share, according to data from Analysys. Tencent doesn't break out the revenues of WeChat Pay, but it makes money by taking a cut of each transaction, and continues to expand its offerings by adding more products and features--most recently launching a tool for immigrant workers in Hong Kong to send remittances home. Analysts expect management to offer insight on payment growth.

TCEHY	Snapchat’s parent company faces steep challenges, and disappointing earnings only underscore that. But investors are missing the bigger picture — this teen favorite isn’t going away. After the closing bell Tuesday, Snap Inc. SNAP, -0.97%  reported a net loss of $443 million, worse than forecasts, on revenue of about $208 million that also fell short of expectations. The result was a deep selloff that pushed the company down as much as 20% after hours, and pushed shares down 50% or so since their March IPO. Yes, those deep losses are only getting deeper as the company spends on growth efforts. Pair that with a miss on Wall Street’s top-line target, and the picture is incredibly disturbing. We’ve seen this movie before, of course, with Twitter Inc. TWTR, -1.89%  riding a string of disappointing reports and unprofitable quarters to similar trouble in the wake of its own public offering. Still, impatience and short-termism shouldn’t fool investors into thinking that Snap is dead. The $15 billion social media giant is indeed seeing real headwinds, but is hardly in danger of disappearing anytime soon. There are big reasons to be wary of how Snap will perform in the coming weeks. But here are seven reasons why long-term bulls can take heart, and have confidence that this tech firm will indeed be around for a long time. Dominance in teen and tween audiences: One of the biggest bull cases for Snap is its popularity. For example, a recent eMarketer report showed Snapchat was outpacing Facebook FB, -1.34% -owned Instagram among users in both the 12-to-17 and 18-to-24 age groups — a big sign of both current appeal and future potential if it builds brand loyalty among young consumers. Apple Fires a Warning Shot at Snap A commitment to broaden the appeal: Of course, the big bombshell dropped by CEO Evan Speigel on the earnings call was that the company is not resting on its laurels with dominance among younger, tech-savvy users. “One thing that we have heard over the years is that Snapchat is difficult to understand or hard to use, and our team has been working on responding to this feedback,” Spiegel said. “As a result, we are currently redesigning our application to make it easier to use.” That nod toward accessibility is a big step toward broadening Snapchat’s already significant appeal. TimeSnap Inc.May 17Jul 17Sep 17Nov 17Jan 18Mar 18 US:SNAP $12.5 $15.0 $17.5 $20.0 $22.5 Stock price reflects struggles with Wall Street, not users:Of course, connecting with users is very different from connecting with gray-haired stock analysts. Snapchat has struggled mightily since its spring IPO thanks to a string of self-inflicted wounds during each subsequent earnings season — including comparing ascendant rival Facebook to stodgy old Yahoo, and a non-answer last quarter that irked one analyst in a public way. But short-term reactions on Wall Street aren’t the ultimate arbiter of long-term success, and there are plenty of execs that struggle to connect with investors but still manage to build successful companies. Lower targets aren’t a death knell: If you look past some gloomy headlines about recent downgrades, you’ll see that targets have moved down but are hardly predicting disaster. For instance, Oppenheimer cut its price target to $14 but maintained its “outperform” rating. RBC cut its rating from “outperform” with a $20 target to “sector perform” with a $15 target. Stifel Nicolaus downgraded the stock from “buy” with an $18 target to “hold” with a $13 target. Keep in mind with shares just under $13 as of this writing, none of those predictions sound like Wall Street is expecting a collapse — just less potential upside than previously thought. Tencent’s big investment: Even though this was overshadowed by the earnings news, recent investments from China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY, -2.58% 0700, +1.28%  — revealed in filings earlier this week — showed a big vote of confidence in the firm. Admittedly, Snap is structured in a way that even big investors get zero voting rights if they own Class A shares like the ones the Chinese tech giant purchased. However, the major investment is assuredly a sign of confidence as it brings Tencent’s stake up to 12%. That could be a prelude to a deep partnership if not an eventual acquisition. How we got here: A history of the use of tech in toys Moving beyond photo filters: While we’ve yet to see anything tangible, Snap has been plowing a lot of cash into personnel and R&D. A rumored revamp of its Spectacles hardware with an augmented reality filter has also been making the rounds, and could be an interesting product to watch. While advertising dollars are still far and away the largest source of revenue, Snap is hardly sitting still and simply looking to monetize its flagship app better. That bodes well for its long-term potential. Snap leadership and balance sheet is safe: Those nonvoting shares ensure there won’t be any shortsighted restructuring anytime soon. The founders are firmly in charge with a long-term vision, and there’s little Wall Street can do about it. And with even though it’s losing money, Snap is still well capitalized with roughly $2.8 billion in cash and investments. These facts show this isn’t a company on the brink of a crisis in the next few months or even the next few years.

TCEHY	Shares of Snap Inc. SNAP, -0.97% bounced to pare earlier sharp losses in premarket trade Wednesday, as the social media company's disclosure that Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY, -2.58% 0700, +1.28% took a large stake helped offset disappointing third-quarter results. The stock was down 9.1% in active premarket trade, but was down as much as 21.4% earlier. Volume was 7.8 million shares about two hours before the open, making it the most actively traded stock in the premarket. The Snapchat parent said in its quarterly filing with the SEC that Chinese technology giant Tencent and its affiliates acquired in November about 145.8 million Class A Snap shares, which represents about 17% of the Class A shares outstanding, or about 12% of the total shares outstanding. That would be enough to make Tencent the largest shareholder. Late Tuesday, Snap's stock plunged reported a wider-than-expected loss and revenue that rose less than expected. Snap's stock had closed Tuesday at $15.12, or down 38% from its first day of trade on March 2, and 11% below its IPO price of $17. In comparison, the Renaissance IPO ETF IPO, -0.82% had gained 22% from March 2 through Tuesday, while the S&P 500 SPX, -2.19% had climbed 8.8%.

TCEHY	"Baidu Inc.'s big jump in profit didn't please investors, who reacted sourly to missed revenue estimates and sent shares of its American depositary receipts tumbling 10% to $234 after hours. The company's revenue rose 29% to 23.49 billion yuan, or $3.53 billion--within the company's own guidance, but below Wall Street's expectations of 23.64 billion yuan, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Baidu's net income surged to 7.95 billion yuan from 3.10 billion yuan a year earlier, thanks to the sale of Baidu Waimai--the company's food-delivery business--to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.-backed Ele.me this summer. The search-engine firm is continuing to try to boost its ad business, which still generates most of its revenue. This is despite government scrutiny following a scandal over medical listings last year and more recent restrictions on online ads ahead of the Communist Party congress that ended this week. Baidu is China's dominant search engine, but in recent years it has expanded into self-driving cars, video-streamed entertainment and voice-assisted products, as it strives to keep pace with its faster-growing internet rivals, Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd. Its tepid results came amid Baidu's efforts to reposition itself as an artificial-intelligence leader. But it is under pressure from competition from Tencent and Alibaba--which are also pushing AI-products, as well as search and newsfeed endeavors. Baidu's also feeling the heat from newer outlets, such as news aggregator Jinri Toutiao. On a conference call with analysts, Baidu executives stressed the importance of the firm's voice-assisted products and its open-source autonomous driving platform as future growth drivers, but cautioned that the returns from these AI products will take years to come. Research and development costs reached 3.24 billion yuan in the latest period, up 24% from a year ago. Baidu has pledged to deliver a self-driving bus by the end of next year and fully autonomous cars by 2021, and has been investing heavily. Baidu's video-streaming platform, iQiyi, earned strong viewership from original content, such as reality-show ""The Rap of China"" producing 2.7 billion views during the first season. But rising content costs, which jumped 76% from a year earlier, weighed down Baidu's results. The company also said it didn't stream some of its most popular series in the past week out of respect for the 19th Party Congress, China's twice-a-decade political meeting that determines leadership for the next five years. The move could have an effect on the company's current quarter, for which Baidu projected revenue of 22.23 billion yuan to 23.41 billion yuan--below analysts' estimates of 24.78 billion yuan.

TCEHY	After more than eight years in this bull market, you might think it’s time to exit U.S. stocks. I’m not convinced age alone will kill this bull. U.S. shares are at record highs, which by itself is not a bad thing. But if you think they’re overextended, here’s a simple solution: Move abroad. Foreign stocks look attractive relative to U.S. shares in at least three ways, say portfolio managers at Santa Fe, New Mexico-based Thornburg Investment Management, which oversees about $50 billion. 1. Youth Economic expansions in many foreign countries are younger than in the U.S., points out Ben Kirby, portfolio manager at the Thornburg Developing World Fund THDAX, -0.96%  Europe went through a double-dip recession in 2011. A lot of emerging market economies were hit by recessions from 2012 to 2015. So those places are much earlier in the economic cycle than the U.S., he says. This means they still have a lot more people to put back to work, and more slack in their economies to fill out. The upshot is that companies abroad may have a lot more potential earnings growth ahead than U.S. companies. Emerging market economies will also continue to benefit from the growth of the middle class, a big-picture trend that has more people moving up, getting better jobs and spending more. “That should be a multi-decade trend. We are very optimistic on the long-term potential for emerging markets,” says Kirby. 2. Surprise Ultimately, stock moves are all about earnings growth. Emerging market companies are posting faster earnings growth than U.S. companies, and more earnings surprises, says Kirby. They are also getting more upward earnings estimates revisions, often a precursor of more growth. 3. Value Foreign stocks have generally been rising more than U.S. stocks. The Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets VWO, -1.77% and the Vanguard FTSE Europe VGK, -0.33%  exchange traded funds are up around 23%-26% in the past year, compared with about 11% for the S&P 500 Index SPX, -2.19% But because of rapid earnings growth, price-to-earnings multiples of many foreign markets have held steady. The “e” has kept pace with the “p.” So these markets still look cheap relative to U.S. markets. The S&P 500 trades for a P/E of about 17, compared with about 15 in Europe, says Greg Dunn, portfolio manager for the Thornburg International Growth Fund TIGAX, -0.67% If earnings acceleration abroad continues, which he expects, foreign markets may narrow the gap. Of course, there are risks with emerging markets. Higher interest rates in the U.S. — driven up either by the markets or by the Federal Reserve if inflation rises — could weigh on them, says Kirby. And there is some froth. Dunn favors Europe over emerging markets, where he sees excesses in areas like tech and the internet, especially in China. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, -2.93%  and Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY, -2.58% for example, have more than doubled in the past 18 months. This makes sense in a way because their fundamentals are strong. But the stock price gains have outpaced the gains in fundamentals. Investing outside the U.S. One way to invest abroad is to buy shares of Dunn’s Thornburg International Growth Fund. It beats competing funds significantly over one and 10 years, which is a good signal even if it lags slightly at three and five years, according to Morningstar, which gives the fund a four-star rating out of five. If you like to brave the world of individual stock ownership, here are five foreign stocks that Dunn and other Thornburg managers like. These all trade on U.S. exchanges, which make them a lot easier to buy in U.S.-based brokerage accounts. Wirecard Wirecard AG WCAGY, -0.55% is a German payment-processing company that handles about 20% of online transactions in Europe. Dunn expects its rapid growth to continue as more people buy more stuff online. It should also gain as “Generation Z,” or people born after 1995, grow up and earn more. They currently make about half their purchases online, compared with 10% for the overall population. “As that generation ages and their spending power increases, I don’t think they are going to move from 50% to 10%,” says Dunn. “It is more likely the broader population will move closer to 50%.” Wirecard shares have more than doubled in the past year. So anyone who buys now may need patience to see significant gains. Zalando Zalando SE ZLNDY, -1.20% is an online fashion apparel company based in Germany, which should also benefit as more people buy more stuff online. Zalando has been aggregating brands for years in its online mall, so it has the size and experience to help it ride this wave, believes Dunn. The company uses data mining to identify its trendiest customers. Then it stocks up on what they buy. Risks here include the expansion of Amazon.com AMZN, -3.20% and Alibaba BABA, -2.93%  into Europe. Fomento Económico Mexicano FEMSA FMX, -1.63% as it’s known on its home turf in Mexico, is a beverage and retail giant in Latin America. It operates through its FEMSA Cerveza and Coca-Cola FEMSA divisions, and a chain of convenience stores called OXXO. FEMSA has 15,000 OXXO stores and the potential to double that count, believes Dunn, as it continues to consolidate the fragmented mom-and-pop convenience-store sector. Convenience stores are unlikely to get crushed by online competition because they provide immediate gratification. FEMSA also has burgeoning drug-store and filling-station businesses that could contribute substantially to growth. Kerry Group Based in Ireland, Kerry Group PLC KRYAY, +0.08%  sells ingredients that improve the taste, appearance, texture and safety of food, drinks and medicine. It has pricing power because its ingredients account for only a small portion of the overall cost of products made by its customers. So they don’t quibble much over price increases. The company will also benefit by rolling out new products, says Dunn, and from the ongoing consolidation in this fragmented sector. This is listed on the pink sheets in the U.S. and volume is relatively light. So you’ll have to go with a small position or be patient as a buyer. Qudian Thornburg International Value Fund TGVAX, -0.59% portfolio manager Lei Wang says he inadvertently enjoyed a free meal in China recently when friends had to pick up the tab because a restaurant declined to accept his credit card or cash. It only took payment via a popular Chinese mobile phone app. Wang likes to tell this story to demonstrate the ubiquity of digital financial apps and cutting-edge “fintech” in China. If you prefer data, here’s more evidence. Last year in China, $5.5 trillion worth of transactions took place on mobile-payment platforms, compared with $100 billion in the U.S., says Wang. His fund participated in the recent initial public offering (IPO) of China-based Qudian Inc. QD, -4.95% as a play on this theme. Qudian offers young consumers small lines of credit for discretionary spending — on their phones, of course. The company’s service is built into Alibaba’s platform. Qudian should also benefit from the spendy ways of young people in China, who open their wallets and borrow more readily than their thriftier parents. Given the froth in Chinese internet stocks, which could help explain the timing of this IPO, it might pay to wait for Qudian to fall to its $24 a share IPO price, or below. It’s getting close.

TCEHY	Data-storage company Western Digital revealed at its San Jose campus a new technology that enables capacity increases in hard drives that could span to 2030 and even beyond. This generational leap, called microwave-assisted magnetic recording (MAMR), will provide enterprise and OEM customers with headroom for continued expansion of storage as the need for larger sources of data continues to grow, while giving Western Digital WDC, -3.05%   a competitive advantage for many years. The need for storage in enterprise and the cloud is continuing to increase at a staggering rate. Application and service providers such as Facebook FB, -1.34% Google GOOG, -2.02% Amazon AMZN, -3.20%  and others build platforms on which the entirety of current compute, mobile and expanding Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure resides. Western Digital executives believe they will have a two- to three-year lead over competing manufacturers like Seagate and Toshiba. Customers and business are creating terabytes of data hourly, including videos, 3D models, high-quality imagery, behavioral data and more. Add to that projections that machine-created data, used for deep learning and artificial-intelligence applications, could be 50 times what is manually created, and it is easy to understand the need for higher capacity and denser storage options. Since the mid-2000s, most of the storage industry has predicted that the growth of flash memory, used in solid-state drives from companies like Samsung SSNLF, -3.07% Intel INTC, -3.16% and Toshiba, would eventually overtake traditional spinning hard drives by offering a lower cost per gigabyte. Flash offers substantial performance benefits over hard drives, but in bulk storage environments where performance is non-critical, which is 90% or more of the enterprise storage market, cost remains the most critical factor. Because of the stagnation in hard-drive technology density that’s projected through the rest of the decade, most believed that the migration to flash was inevitable. Western Digital has shown that with this new MAMR technology, there is headroom in hard drives going forward to 2030 and beyond, fundamentally changing the outlook for hard-drive products for the next decade with a target shown of 40 terabyte drive availability in 2025. Read: The cyberwars are coming — here’s how to prepare (and make money) The technology that Western Digital built was done in-house, with help from researchers from Carnegie Mellon University. Because of that, executives believe that they will have a two- to three-year lead over competing manufacturers like Seagate STX, -2.80%  and Toshiba, giving Western Digital an edge on capacity and cost inside that window. As a result, the outlook for Western Digital to gain market and mind share with the critical “Super 7” customers of Facebook, Google, Microsoft MSFT, -2.33% Amazon, Alibaba BABA, -2.93% Baidu BIDU, -2.55% and Tencent TCEHY, -2.58%  is extremely positive. Another industry implication of MAMR technology is that it means the potential crossover point for mass adoption of flash-based storage in non-performance-critical enterprise markets is going to be further out than expected. Groups such as IMFT (Intel and Micron joint venture) and Samsung, which have been planning for that shift, will see another five or more years added to the timeline. Teenagers, just like their parents, want iPhones more than ever MAMR is a technology that uses microwave resonance (like an MRI) to make it possible to write to smaller areas of a disk platter reliably. It uses existing infrastructure and materials for much of the process but requires significant R&D to implement efficiently. The result is a capability to jumpstart increases in density on hard drives over time without significant cost increases, performance questions or platform incompatibility. Competing products that have been in the running to address hard-drive scaling, including HAMR (heat-assisted magnetic recording), require larger investments in production facilities and present questions of reliability as it involves heating up elements on the disk platter upwards of 1,300 Fahrenheit. Western Digital was an early part of the development of that technology as well, and that gives it a unique ability to measure the pros and cons of both. With its announcement, Western digital has drawn a line in the sand and determined that MAMR is the future.

TCEHY	The drama in North Korea continues this week, with — what else! — a threat from our Tweeter in Chief. Soon after Donald Trump warned he would “totally destroy” North Korea in a divisive speech before the United Nations, he took to social media to warn the nation’s leaders would “not be around much longer” if they continue to pursue missiles and a nuclear program. These events adds to the increasingly long list of worries that U.S. investors now face. But despite the risk of geopolitical unrest in Asia, the region still appears to be an appealing place to invest, particularly in North Korea’s neighbor to the north — China. Some may think it’s crazy to invest in the region after recent rhetoric. And others may think it’s insane to give up on the S&P 500 SPX, -2.19%   as it continues to set new all-time highs. But on the former point, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index has shrugged off recent political tensions fairly easily and is actually outperforming the S&P handily in 2017. And on the later, it’s important to remember that the U.S. is far from perfect itself: its stock market is looking shaky; job and wage growth is slowing; and the market has once again overestimated how much profit corporations are actually taking in. There is never a clear signal for investors to move their money. But if you look deeper, you may find some compelling reasons to consider investing in China right now, North Korea or no. Red-hot performance: Since Jan. 1, the Hang Seng HSI, +1.16% is up 25% and the more broad-based Asia Dow Index ADOW, +0.56%  is up about 18%. (The more established Hang Seng index based out of Hong Kong is a true proxy of market interest in Chinese corporations than the Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, +0.10% which is dominated by domestic retail investors in China, and thus more prone to short-term volatility.) The biggest Chinese names trading on U.S. exchanges are doing amazingly well. Alibaba Group BABA, -2.93%   is up over 90% year-to-date and Baidu BIDU, -2.55%  is up 45%. Outside of tech, hotelier China Lodging Group HTHT, -1.96%  is up over 130% and $15 billion manufacturing play Aluminum Corp. of China ACH, -1.52%  has more than doubled. Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future returns — and both the Hang Seng and the Shanghai Composite have struggled to move higher since August. Here's how to use compound interest to get rich Clearly no credit crisis: There has been a great deal of fearmongering over the years about how China is in a credit bubble and that a “hard landing” is inevitable. Not only has the dreaded debt crisis not happened, but the reality is that 2017 is seeing tremendous demand for emerging-market debt. The New York Times recently reported that debt sales from emerging-market corporations has topped $342 billion through the third quarter, with China representing 27% of that total. It hardly sounds like a crisis when debt is cheap and the West is eager to lend to Chinese companies. Growth is beating expectations: China topped GDP estimates in the first half of 2017 with a 6.9% expansion rate. That was a significant beat after soft 2016 data rattled some investors, and the details show both imports and exports beat expectations, too. Compare that with the U.S., which barely made it back to 3.0% GDP growth in the second quarter for the first time in two years. Investors are moving overseas: August fund flows showed a $14 billion net drawdown in U.S. equity funds and a $16 billion net increase in international equity funds, according to Morningstar data released this week. In its most recent weekly report, FactSet reported the more active universe of ETFs sucked in more money via overseas equity funds than in domestic equity funds. Given challenging valuations and uncertainty in the West, it’s no wonder investors are looking overseas. Beijing is motivated to succeed: Sure, China lacks a true democracy or free-market system. But if you think that leaves top officials unaccountable if things go south, think again. This is particularly important in 2017, as the National Congress of the Communist Party of China convenes next month and President Xi Jinping is looking for another five-year term. Domestic stability and prosperity are crucial to those in power keeping it as well as preventing civil or economic disruptions that challenge their authority. We can moralize over the nature of a command-and-control government in China, but the bottom line is that the fortunes of those in power are closely tied to the fortunes of Chinese stocks and the local economy. As an investor, that’s a powerful backstop. China's New Nationalists So what’s the trade? If you are looking to move your money into China, there are a bunch of good options. Megacap tech stocks in China have been a particularly good tactical bet in 2017, most notably Alibaba, as pointed out earlier. Given the growth of China’s digital economy, that will surely continue. However, if you’re uncomfortable picking individual names but still want to play this hot sector, consider the lesser known KraneShares CSI China internet ETF KWEB, -2.46% Its digital flavor makes it focused on the biggest names in China including Alibaba, Tencent ( TCEHY, -2.58% 0700, +1.18% Baidu and JD.com JD, -2.39% With about $1 billion in assets since it was launched more than four years ago, it’s hardly an opportunistic fund that just launched out of someone’s garage. For those looking to invest in a broader and less tactical way, the most popular vehicle is the iShares China Large-Cap ETF FXI, -2.17%  (FXI) that holds well over $3 billion in assets. However, the fund has roughly a third of its cash stashed in just four positions and is a bit too top-heavy for my tastes. Most of the biggest China ETFs are overweight just a few names like this, but not all. A more diversified way to play the region is the Deutsche X-trackers China A-Shares Fund ASHR, -2.54% Not only is this fund more diversified with only a single holding weighted at more than 5% currently, it is also a true China fund. As the name implies, ASHR focuses on “A Shares” — companies that trade on Chinese exchanges in Chinese currency — instead of “B Shares” that are mainly owned outside the region. This fund’s direct investment in China pays off in a direct way when things are good; ASHR is up almost 25% year-to-date, neck and neck with the Hang Seng benchmark index and more than double the S&P 500.

TCEHY	For all its global popularity, Nintendo Co. has had relatively limited business in China. Now a deal with Tencent Holdings Ltd. has investors excited at the prospect that Nintendo’s Switch console and smartphone games could take off in one of the world’s biggest game markets. Nintendo NTDOY, -2.36%  shares shot up by more than 7% to a nine-year high Tuesday as investors welcomed its deal to put one of China’s most popular videogames—Tencent’s “Honor of Kings”—on the Nintendo Switch this winter. The game is called “Arena of Valor” in Europe, and a U.S. launch under that name is set for later this year. For the moment, the deal, disclosed last week in a Nintendo video posted online, doesn’t directly involve users in China because the Switch isn’t sold there. But it could be a precursor to further arrangements allowing Nintendo to sell the Switch and its mobile games in China, said people familiar with the thinking of Nintendo and Tencent TCEHY, -2.58%  executives. “This is very positive in the longer term in getting Chinese publishers supporting the Switch,” said Macquarie Capital Securities analyst David Gibson. He said he expected Nintendo to introduce the Switch in China by March 2019.

TCEHY	The shiny new iPhones unveiled on Tuesday will definitely be exciting for Apple, but this announcement won’t move the stock as much as emerging markets and new technologies will. For a value investor like me, it is easier to love stocks that are hated and more difficult to love stocks that are loved. Love is usually expensive, and the infatuation gets reflected in a company’s valuation. Hate, or near-hate, is cheap. Being contrarian — taking a position that goes against the grain of commonly held opinion — isn’t easy or comfortable. Humans take comfort in consensus. We love it when the crowd agrees with us. But being contrarian for the sake of being different is idiotic and dangerous. When it comes to investing, being contrarian means trusting and following through on the findings of your research, whether you agree or disagree with the crowd. So it is now with Apple AAPL, -2.56%  and me. I felt that “contrarian” feeling about the stock when my firm sold the bulk of our Apple stake . It was the same discomort I had in 2013 when we were buying. This is the Key Feature of the New iPhone But let me tell you where I could be wrong: While a more expensive iPhone will boost Apple’s earnings, it will also have an unintended consequence: lengthening the upgrade cycle. On the other hand, Apple may come up with incremental innovations that keep people excited about iPhones, and the upgrade cycle will remain stable. Emerging markets are also encouraging. For example, India may prove to be a fruitful market for Apple. iPhone penetration there is quite low, Apple is building new stores, and India has a billion-plus people. The problem is that India is an extremely poor country. Half of its population doesn’t even have indoor plumbing, and a third doesn’t have electricity. Accordingly, for a long time, Apple will be an aspirational brand for a substantial part of the Indian population. TimeApple Inc.May 17Jul 17Sep 17Nov 17Jan 18Mar 18 US:AAPL $140 $150 $160 $170 $180 What about China? To be sure, China is supposed to a growth engine for Apple, but that may not be the case. WeChat TCEHY, -2.58%   is a huge problem for Apple. Someone described WeChat to me as a Chinese version of Facebook FB, -1.34%  plus WhatsApp. The more I learn about WeChat, the more I realize it is so much more than that. It is basically “the mobile internet” in China. People turn on their phones, jump on WeChat, and don’t have to go anywhere else. It’s Facebook and WhatsApp, but it’s also an app and game store, payment platform, Yelp, and a whole lot more. From a mobile phone perspective, WeChat is an operating system layer on top of iOS or Android. If you are a WeChat user, you don’t really care about any improvements in the underlying operating system, because you barely use it. Samsung 005930, +1.24%  comes out with a new, spiffier phone a year now, and your switching “inconvenience” costs are almost zero. WeChat basically kills iPhone user loyalty and the recurrence of revenues that Apple masterfully developed in the West. Read: How to make $800 hawking your old iPhone What else is moving in Apple’s favor? Next generation 5G technology will allow much faster downloads and may end up creating another super upgrade cycle for the iPhone. So-called augmented reality (AR) may be another driver that I am underestimating. It’s possible that the iPhone may turn into a delivery device of earth-shattering innovations for Apple. I say all this and then I look at my three- and four-year-old iPads. Newer versions are thinner, have faster processors, better screens. The ones I have are just good enough. When will iPhone reach this same “good enough” point? Frankly, I don’t know. As an Apple junkie (I own so many Apple products it’s almost embarrassing) I’m excited for Apple. But I’m less excited about Apple stock than I’ve been in years, and the current valuation demands more clairvoyance than I possess.

TCEHY	Analyzing this market is an open and shut case. That is, thanks to what Bill O’Neil always has said: Watch the major averages and the leading stocks. That’s it. Those two indicators have withstood the test of time, obviating the need for anything else. These are not crystal ball indicators, the type that tell you where the market is headed. Those don’t exist. But the averages and leaders do serve to keep one on the right side of the market. The averages show a clear downtrend of lower highs and lower lows up until the last three sessions, including Thursday. One would normally want to see Nasdaq volume picking up substantially to confirm this newfound conviction (see the Nasdaq Composite chart below). However, this happens to be perhaps the most popular week in the year for vacations. This accounts for the below-average activity on both Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange. Of note are the Nasdaq closes of Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. They are in the upper quartile of the day’s range and close to the day’s high. This is a distinct positive. As for the leading stocks, senior growth issues hold up fairly well. This is key. Sure, Amazon.com AMZN, -3.20% Netflix NFLX, -1.74%    and Tesla TSLA, -2.10%  have been as much as 13% off their highs. However, they are well-deserving of a rest in the wake of big gains. These pullbacks appear normal, although in Amazon’s case there is too much high-volume selling for comfort. Meanwhile, Apple AAPL, -2.56% Facebook FB, -1.34%  Tesla, Paypal PYPL, -4.02% Alibaba BABA, -2.93% Salesforce.com CRM, -2.47% Baidu BIDU, -2.55% and Tencent Holdings TCEHY, -2.58%  trade close to their highs. So, generally, the action of the leading stocks, which have been large growth names for some time, remains in good shape. This could change tomorrow or next week. But since there are no crystal balls here, we operate on what the market has already done. Besides technology XLK, -2.45% the only other area showing leadership is utilities XLU, -0.79% if anything, a defensive sector. Chart created using MarketSmith. ©2017 MarketSmith Incorporated. All rights reserved. Among the names, Apple holds strong for one reason: The Street expects it to post 20% earnings growth in the September 2018 fiscal year. This would be a pick-up from the expected 9% growth of the 2017 fiscal year. Ultra-liquid names that lead the market and are forecast to grow earnings by 20% do not grow on trees. They are prized by institutions with a growth mandate. Very few of them exist in a market which has been light on initial public offerings for a number of years. Read: Should you buy Apple stock ahead of the iPhone 8 launch? For speculators seeking some long exposure with low risk attached, entrance at the current price of $164 could be had. Using the most recent swing low of $155.11 (the Aug. 21 low) as a protective stop, risk would be about 5.4%. With a junior starter position (half normal), de facto risk would be about 2.7%. As price is already 5% past the top of the most recent base, the stock should not be chased beyond current levels. This, plus Sept. 12 being the iPhone 8 event, augurs for a junior position to begin with and not a full-boat position. (This event could possibly spur a buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news reaction.) (As always, a protective stop should be used to mitigate risk, along with a starter position that is half normal size, or less. This initial position could be added to if the stock proves itself. In most cases, a position should not be entered when price is extended, i.e. more than 5% past the top of its base for breakout buys.) Chart created using MarketSmith. ©2017 MarketSmith Incorporated. All rights reserved. Tesla gives a good account of itself as it repairs its chart pattern following the June-July slide from $386 to $303. Price sits at $345. There has not been any high-volume selling in weeks. The $370 swing high of Aug. 9 offers a convenient way of entering the stock without taking the risk of it rolling over from here. Specifically, a breakout above $370 on big volume should offer the evidence needed to show Tesla is on solid footing with the June-July malaise behind it. Read: Tesla Model 3 killer?

The Bay Area-headquartered concern shed red ink in 2015 and 2016 but is projected by most analysts to score a per-share profit of 26 cents this year and 61 cents next. Revenue growth has been triple-digit in recent quarters. Technically, the stock broke out of a six-week flat base Thursday, though volume was likely below average due to the plethora of end-of-summer vacations. At this writing, price is 3% above the top of the base and can be taken here with a protective stop placed below the $26.08 low of 8/18 and 8/21. To sum, our two primary indicators, the price-volume behavior of the averages and the action of the leading stocks, point to the market’s direction being up. For its part, the Nasdaq Composite has had a three-day turnaround of sorts this week. While volume was light, next week will provide a clearer reading as trading desks will be close to fully-staffed. As well, leading growth stocks appear in good shape, with some going through what seems to be normal corrective action following big gains earlier in the year.

TCEHY	Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. posted double-digit revenue and profit increases as it continued to grow its mobile-gaming, social-media and advertising businesses in the second quarter. Tencent, one of China's largest publicly traded companies and the world's biggest videogame publisher by revenue, also operates the popular social-media app WeChat. Mobile-game revenue grew 54% and exceeded computer games revenue for the first time. Computer-game revenue grew 29%, but the company warned that future PC revenue growth rates would decline. The company posted 14.8 billion yuan ($2.21 billion) in mobile revenue and 13.6 billion yuan in computer revenue. Its share price has rose 70% so far this year. The company said its WeChat app, known in China as Weixin, saw 963 million monthly average users in the quarter, growing 19.5% from a year earlier. Another of the company's social-media networks, QQ, saw a 5.4% decline in monthly active users to 850 million. Still, Tencent said the decrease was due to fewer casual users while engagement with core users increased. QQ also saw smart-device growth among younger users. Online advertising revenue grew 55% to 10.15 billion yuan, driven by increased mobile video views as TV dramas and variety shows attracted users. In all, profit grew 70% to 18.23 billion yuan, or 1.9 yuan a share, compared with 10.74 billion yuan, or 1.13 yuan a share, a year prior. Revenue grew 59% to 56.6 billion yuan. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected 53.03 billion yuan in revenue and profit of 1.52 yuan a share. Chester Yung contributed to this article.

TCEHY	"SHANGHAI -- Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler AG is investing in a Chinese self-driving startup, in another instance of a Western auto maker seeking out a Chinese partner to get a foothold in a challenging market. The Stuttgart, Germany-based automotive giant made its first ever investment in a Chinese startup this week, taking part in a $46 million funding round for Momenta, a Beijing-based firm providing road sensors and high definition mapping software. Other investors in Momenta include NIO, an electric-vehicle maker backed by Tencent Holdings that has pledged to sell fully autonomous cars in the U.S. in 2020. Daimler declined to comment. It joins peers such as Hyundai Motors Co. in aligning with Chinese firms as the race to develop an autonomous vehicle revs up. Western auto makers face high hurdles entering China because the country considers the kind of mapping needed to make self-driving cars work a national security issue and limits it to domestic companies. Foreign software and car companies also could face difficulty gaining approval to conduct test drives in the country, The Wall Street Journal recently reported. China has made self driving cars part of its national agenda, setting autonomous vehicle targets and creating sandboxes to test such technology, as Beijing makes a big push to dominate the world's artificial intelligence industry by 2030. In a plan unveiled by the State Council on July 20, China pledged to invest and groom technologies from autonomous driving to computer vision for use in sectors such as national security and manufacturing. By 2030, China forecasts its core AI industries to be worth 1 trillion yuan ($148 billion). China differs from the U.S. in regulations, environment and domestic protection, and startups in the Asian nation are attractive to foreign investors, said Jackie Yang, a managing director at venture-capital firm TransLink Capital. ""The local startups have either developed a technology and product that addresses the China market better or have a better price-performance equation,"" he said. Venture capital is pouring into the sector. Beijing-based TuSimple, one of the three Chinese startups to receive an autonomous vehicle test permit from California in the last two months, also expects to announce in the next month that it has raised $20 million from investors, according to people familiar with the company.

TCEHY	"Tesla Inc. said it is exploring with government officials in Shanghai the possibility of opening a facility to build electric vehicles for the Chinese market. The Silicon Valley auto maker reiterated Thursday it plans to define its production plans for China by year's end. China, the world's largest market for new-car sales and a big consumer of luxury vehicles, is an important market for Tesla, especially as the government pushes for more electric vehicles. ""Tesla is deeply committed to the Chinese market, and we continue to evaluate potential manufacturing sites around the globe to serve the local markets,"" Tesla said in a statement. ""While we expect most of our production to remain in the U.S., we do need to establish local factories to ensure affordability for the markets they serve."" Tesla didn't mention a local joint-venture partner. China requires foreign auto makers to operate factories with local partners, though officials have signaled a willingness to relax such requirements. In May, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, who had recently visited China, cryptically suggested such rule changes would be ""good timing."" By making cars in China, Tesla could cut the prices of its vehicles by a third by reducing shipping costs and avoiding import duties, Mr. Musk has said. In afternoon trading in New York on Thursday, Tesla's shares rose about 2% to $383.99. The stock is up about 80% this year. China charges a 25% duty on all imported cars, but the hefty markup hasn't deterred affluent buyers who regard a Tesla vehicle as a prestige item. One Chinese Tesla owner, Chen Zhanchong, said he paid $176,000 for a Tesla Model S P90D in late 2015, well over the sales price in the U.S. But the 31-year-old Guangzhou resident, who recently left his job at an internet company, said it was still a good value for a high-performance electric car. ""If a cheap Model 3 is produced in China in large quantities, local companies won't be able to compete,"" Mr. Chen said. ""Tesla will enjoy explosive growth."" Tesla reported over $1 billion in revenue in China in 2016, a figure that analysts believe equates to around 11,000 vehicle sales. The company sold just over 76,000 cars globally last year. And sales in China have accelerated in 2017: Tesla sold around 5,500 cars in China in the first four months of the year, according to EV Sales, a website that tracks the electric-vehicle market. Yet while local manufacturing gives Tesla the opportunity to sell cars in far greater numbers, China's fast-changing regulatory environment is creating uncertainty among foreign auto makers unsure about what Beijing's requirements will be. Current regulations also require manufacturers building electric cars in China to source all vehicle components locally. That presents a challenge for Tesla, which won't be able to use batteries made in its U.S. ""gigafactory"" in its Chinese-built cars, said Bill Russo, managing director of Gao Feng Advisory, a Shanghai-based auto consulting firm. Tesla may be forced to form a joint venture with a local battery maker, as well as a car maker, he said. Even so, Tesla has no choice but to manufacture vehicles in China, despite the regulatory uncertainties, in order to achieve scale and tap what is already the world's biggest market for electric cars, Mr. Russo said. ""On a positive note, China is willing to allow the premier EV brand to plant its flag on Chinese soil,"" he said, referring to Tesla. ""Tesla needs China. And China needs Tesla -- it wants to show they're not a closed ecosystem."" Recent events signaled that Tesla is moving closer to committing to opening a factory in China, analysts said. Chinese internet company Tencent Holdings acquired a 5% stake in Tesla for $1.78 billion in March, and Mr. Musk met with senior government officials in Beijing the following month. --Junya Qian contributed to this article.

TCEHY	"HONG KONG -- Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. reported a steep rise in profit and revenue in the first quarter, notching solid growth in its core gaming and online-advertising businesses. Tencent, China's largest company by market capitalization and the world's biggest videogame publisher by revenue, operates the popular social-media app WeChat. Its share price has soared 36% this year. The company said higher revenue from some of its most popular online games helped boost its net profit to 14.48 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) for the three months ended in March, up 58% from a year earlier. Overall revenue was up 55% to 49.55 billion yuan. ""Our key platforms continue to grow robustly,"" Chief Executive Officer Pony Ma told investors, pointing to the more than 900 million users of the company's popular WeChat social-media app. ""We believe our video, news, literature and music services are each the largest in China as measured by usage."" Already a major force in China, Tencent has been quietly raising its overseas profile through partnerships and investments. Last year it joined with Chinese investors to buy Finnish game developer Supercell Oy, maker of ""Clash of Clans,"" for $8.6 billion. In March it disclosed a $1.8 billion investment in electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc. Though it said little about the goals of its investment in Tesla at the time, Tencent on Wednesday said it sees the car maker as a partner in connecting more devices to the internet. ""The automobile is becoming a smart device, and there will be much more connections between the physical world and the virtual world,"" Tencent President Martin Lau said. Earlier this week the company announced a big expansion of its music-streaming business with a licensing agreement with Universal Music Group. Tencent distributes music through its QQ Music, KuGou and Kuwo services, and the deal makes it the main distributor in China for Universal records and artists. Tencent said its revenue from online gaming, its biggest source, was up 34% to 22.8 billion yuan, lifted by the likes of ""Honor of Kings"" and ""Dragon Nest Mobile."" Online advertising revenue was up 47%, to 6.9 billion yuan.

TCEHY	"Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. reported a steep rise in profit and revenue in the first quarter, notching solid growth in its core gaming and online-advertising businesses. Tencent, China's largest company by market capitalization and the world's biggest videogame publisher by revenue, operates the popular social-media app WeChat. Its share price has soared 36% this year. The company said higher revenue from some of its most popular online games helped boost its net profit to 14.48 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) for the three months ended in March, up 58% from a year earlier. Overall revenue was up 55% to 49.55 billion yuan. Already a major force in China, Tencent has been quietly raising its overseas profile through partnerships and investments. Last year it joined with Chinese investors to buy Finnish game developer Supercell Oy, maker of ""Clash of Clans,"" for $8.6 billion. In March it disclosed a $1.8 billion investment in electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc. Earlier this week the company announced a big expansion of its music-streaming business with a licensing agreement with Universal Music Group. Tencent distributes music through its QQ Music, KuGou and Kuwo services, and the deal makes it the main distributor in China for Universal records and artists. Tencent said its revenue from online gaming, its biggest source, was up 34% to 22.8 billion yuan, lifted by the likes of ""Honor of Kings"" and ""Dragon Nest Mobile."" Online advertising revenue was up 47%, to 6.9 billion yuan. The company said its WeChat app, together with the Chinese version, Weixin, boasted 938 million monthly average users in the first quarter, 23% more than a year earlier.

TCEHY	China’s Didi Chuxing Technology Co. said it raised $5.5 billion in a new funding round, which will help fuel its global expansion and push into artificial intelligence. The cash infusion brings the Beijing-based ride-hailing company’s valuation to more than $50 billion, making it one of Asia’s largest startups, according to people familiar with the matter. Didi, which counts Alibaba Group Holding BABA, -2.93%   and Tencent Holdings TCEHY, -2.58%   among its investors, was valued at $36 billion in August after merging its operations with rival Uber Technologies Inc.’s China business following a costly battle for customers. The new funding round includes investments from Menlo Park, CA-based Silver Lake Partners, Tokyo-based Japanese telecom and tech giant SoftBank Corp. , Shenzhen-based China Merchants Bank Co. CIHKY, -1.69%   and China’s Bank of Communications Co. , according to people familiar with the matter. An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.

TCEHY	"The chief financial officer of Chinese search engine Baidu Inc., Jennifer Li, is stepping aside for a new job at the company, the latest in a series of high-level personnel changes as Baidu seeks to catch up with rivals Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. in the fast-changing internet economy. In recent weeks, Baidu has lost chief scientist Andrew Ng in what analysts considered a setback to its efforts to use artificial intelligence to develop new business ventures. Wang Jin, who led Baidu's driverless-car division, also left the company shortly after Mr. Ng's departure. The management changes follow January's decision by company founder and Chief Executive Robin Li to bring in former Microsoft executive Qi Lu as president, with responsibility for day-to-day management. Ms. Li's departure was announced as Baidu reported its earnings after the market close in New York Thursday, where its shares closed up $1.19 to $187.86. In after-hours trading, shares were down 3.75% after Baidu said net income fell 11% to 1.78 billion yuan ($258.1 million). The company reported revenue of 16.89 billion yuan, a 6.8% increase from the same period in 2016, but its revenue forecast for the current quarter came in below estimates. Baidu also said content costs nearly doubled to 2.64 billion yuan, largely tied to online-video arm iQiyi. Meanwhile, research and development costs rose about 35% to 2.83 billion yuan. Ms. Li will serve as chief executive of Baidu Capital, the investment arm launched last fall. At the time, Baidu said the unit would manage a fund of about $3 billion and focus on late-stage technology deals of about $50 million to $100 million. Before joining Baidu in 2008, Ms. Li worked for nearly 15 years at General Motors Co. In the earnings call, Mr. Li said that experience would be an asset at Baidu Capital. The new role is a diminished one for Ms. Li, who has seen her portfolio shrink over the past year as responsibilities for marketing and international media relations have been assigned to other executives, according to people familiar with the situation. Ms. Li couldn't immediately be reached for comment. With Ms. Li leaving the CFO position, there will be no women on Baidu's senior management team or its five-member board. However Mr. Li's spouse, Ma Dongmin, has rejoined the company as a special assistant to Mr. Li. Baidu became China's dominant search engine after Alphabet Inc.'s Google left the country to avoid censorship in 2010. Critics say it was slow to embrace the mobile internet as Alibaba and Tencent grew to dominate not only their core businesses of e-commerce and social media respectively, but also areas such as mobile payments and online personal finance. Baidu's core business, online advertising, took a hit in 2016 after China's regulators introduced stricter laws after the company was embroiled in a series of scandals of misleading medical ads. Since his appointment as president, Mr. Lu has shaken up strategies in Baidu's artificial-intelligence units, including open-sourcing Baidu's self-driving car technology. In Friday's earnings call, he said the firm is seeking to improve online-advertising revenues through a news-search product and will spend less on its lifestyle-services platform Nuomi, which has faced intense competition in the past year. Baidu is also accelerating efforts to commercialize its voice-recognition and autonomous-car units, Mr. Lu said. It is also expanding its search traffic by introducing voice search and image search. ""Our focus is tapping into the current trend of user traffic growth,"" he said. ""As we digitize more and more information, overall search demand will increase."" Baidu's core search revenues could gradually improve, but there are still uncertainties remaining about when the company will be able to monetize its AI investments, said John Choi, an analyst at Daiwa Securities Co. Maria Armental in New York contributed to this article.

TCEHY	"Baidu Inc.'s longtime chief financial officer plans to step down to head the company's investment firm Baidu Capital, the company said Thursday. Jennifer Li, who has held the CFO post for nine years, will become chief executive of Baidu Capital, the company said Thursday as it reported quarterly results. First-quarter profit fell 11% to 1.78 billion yuan ($258.1 million), or 46.29 yuan ($4.63) an ADR. Excluding stock-based compensation and other items, however, profit rose 1.3% to 2.39 billion yuan ($347.2 million). The Chinese search engine giant said revenue rose 7% to 16.89 billion yuan ($2.45 billion) from 15.82 billion yuan a year ago. Thursday's report was the first quarterly earnings since Baidu brought on Qi Lu, a former senior Microsoft executive as group president and chief operating officer to refocus the company's business. Mr. Lu, a Carnegie Mellon scientist was hired in January to help strengthen the Chinese internet firm's emphasis on artificial intelligence. Baidu's fortunes have lagged behind its bigger rivals Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings in the past year, as it failed to capitalize on the boom in mobile internet in China. Many of its efforts in payments, food delivery and group-buying coupon face fierce competition, and online advertising, its core earnings stream, took a hit in 2016 after China's regulators introduced stricter laws in the space. For the current quarter, Baidu forecast revenue of 20.47 billion yuan ($2.97 billion) to 20.98 billion yuan ($3.05 billion), roughly in line with analysts' projected $3.03 billion, according to FactSet. ""While our investment in AI is a long-term proposition, we are already seeing the powerful benefits of AI bear fruit across our existing platform,"" chief executive and founder Robin Li said in a news release. Overall company content costs nearly doubled to 2.64 billion yuan ($382.9 million), largely tied to online video armiQiyi. Meanwhile, research and development costs rose about 35% to 2.83 billion yuan ($411.8 million). In February, Baidu raised $1.53 billion from private-equity investors to expand iQiyi, which recently signed a licensing deal with Netflix, the maker of shows such as House of Cards, expanding its suite of partners such as Paramount Pictures, 21st Century Fox Inc. Since his appointment, Mr. Lu has shaken up strategies in Baidu's artificial intelligence units. He took the unprecedented move of open-sourcing Baidu's self-driving car technology to companies. Baidu also said it would double the size of its AI lab in Silicon Valley and has started recruitment drives in overseas campuses such as Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University to attract talent. Still, his arrival hasn't been without disruption. A string of key Baidu executives have left their post since January. The highest profile departure, Baidu's former chief scientist and Stanford University professor Andrew Ng, said in March he would leave the company to explore a new chapter in his artificial-intelligence work. Connie Gu, an analyst at BoCom International said Baidu's new focus on artificial intelligence is a positive thing, as the Beijing-based company is the strongest player in the space among China's largest technology companies. Ms. Gu said investors are watching to see if this push into artificial intelligence will allow Baidu to raise its search engine quality and revenue. ""The upside to this is that now the search and AI units can cooperate better together and there will be more data sharing,"" Ms. Gu said.

TCEHY	U.K.-based insurer Aviva PLC is looking to sell Friends Provident International Ltd., its unit that serves high-net-worth clients in Asia and the Middle East, in a deal that could fetch up to $750 million, according to people familiar with the situation. Aviva's sale of Friends Provident International comes less than two years after it bought the business in April 2015, as part of a GBP5.6 billion ($8.8 billion) deal to acquire Friends Life Group Ltd., which at the time created the U.K's largest insurance, savings and asset-management company. Based in the Isle of Man, a self-governing island situated between the U.K. and Ireland that many consider a tax haven, Friends Provident International provides life assurance and investment products to global expatriate and domestic affluent customers in Hong Kong, Singapore, United Arab Emirates and other selected markets. Aviva said in its full-year 2016 financial report that Friends Provident International is under strategic review. The insurer sees little growth in the unit, whose main clientele are British expatriates, analysts say. Aviva's gross operating profit in Asia dropped 4% year over year in 2016, compared with a 12% increase in gross operating profit globally. Aviva has received a number of pre-emptive offers for the unit, although a formal bidding process hasn't started, the people said. Chinese conglomerates Fosun Group and HNA Group are among those evaluating the unit, according to two of the people. Both companies declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Aviva said there is no update on the review and declined to comment further. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is running the sale, people familiar with the situation said. The bank declined to comment. Overseas insurance companies are attractive to Chinese buyers as they can then reinvest the premiums collected without going through China's foreign-exchange approval process, a great advantage at a time when the country is tightening its capital outflow. Chinese companies bid aggressively for ING Life's South Korea unit last year. They also struck deals to acquire Singapore-based Asia Capital Reinsurance Group Pte. Ltd., Hong Kong-based Dah Sing Life Assurance Co. and most recently Hong Kong Life Insurance Ltd. In January, Aviva, together with Chinese private-equity firm Hillhouse Capital and tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd., agreed to develop an insurance company in Hong Kong to focus on digital insurance. As part of the agreement, Hillhouse and Tencent would acquire shares in Aviva Life Insurance Company Ltd. (Aviva Hong Kong), the insurer said at the time. Aviva and Hillhouse will each hold a 40% stake and Tencent 20%.

TCEHY	"Online games and social-media advertising are putting a rocket under one of Asia's most valuable technology companies. China's Tencent Holdings Ltd. said Wednesday that revenue and earnings surged in the fourth quarter amid growth in its online gaming business and in advertising revenue from platforms such as its popular WeChat application, which has more than 800 million users. While relatively unknown in the West, Tencent is the world's largest game publisher by revenue--competing with better-known U.S. names such as Electronic Arts Inc. and Activision Blizzard Inc.--and gets nearly half of its revenue from online games. Investors and analysts are watching to see how successfully Tencent can expand its footprint overseas to support its rapid growth rate. Last year, Tencent joined with Chinese investors in an $8.6 billion acquisition of Supercell Oy, the Finnish maker of the popular ""Clash of Clans"" videogame. Tencent already owned Riot Games Inc., the Los Angeles-based developer of ""League of Legends,"" one of the top-grossing PC games. Tencent reported a 47% rise in net profit for the December quarter to 10.53 billion yuan ($1.53 billion) from a year earlier. Net profit for the year rose 43% to 41.10 billion yuan. Revenue rose 48% to 151.94 billion yuan. Tencent is also counting on growth in advertising and mobile payments, where its WeChat mobile wallet competes with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.'s Alipay in China. Connie Gu, an analyst at Bocom International Securities, said her research shows that WeChat's mobile wallet is growing faster than its competitors in offline channels such as supermarkets. ""Online payment is one of the areas that stand out for Tencent,"" said Ms. Gu, who rates Tencent's stock as a buy. To boost its ad revenue, Tencent has been following the lead of rivals such as Facebook Inc. by placing targeted ads in places such as WeChat's Moments section for photos and updates. Tencent's challenge is to increase ad revenue without turning users off the messaging application. ""The company has been very cautious in terms of increasing its ad load, so there's still a lot of upside in this,"" said Richard Ko, an equity analyst at China Merchants Securities. While Tencent's shares fell 1.6% ahead of the company's earnings announcement Wednesday, the recent surge in the Hong-Kong listed stock has allowed it to overtake Alibaba, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, as the world's most valuable emerging-market stock. Tencent's market cap currently stands at roughly $270 billion compared with Alibaba's nearly $261 billion. Chester Yung contributed to this article.

TCEHY	The “Trump trade” has lost its momentum in recent weeks as the stock market has struggled to go much of anywhere, even with Jan. 25’s move in the Dow Jones Industrial Average above 20,000. Amid the uncertainty, it’s not surprising that many investors have already started expressing big concerns about what happens for the rest of 2017 now that President Donald Trump is finally in the White House and we get down to the business of actual business. The 2017 prediction from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, -2.28%  is for the S&P 500 SPX, -2.19%   to end the year in the range of 2,225 to 2,300 — basically where it is now, or a few percentage points higher, at best. Respected analysts at Bank of America Corp. BAC, -2.28% Morgan Stanley MS, -3.32% Credit Suisse Group AG CS, -2.00%  and others view things the same way. Investors already had valuation concerns about U.S. stocks before their big run to finish 2016, and now it seems the hope of a few months ago has been replaced by trepidation that the tough talk and rash of executive orders will actually deliver on aggressive — and some say, unrealistic — promises of a return to 4% GDP growth for the U.S. Read: Here’s why a Trump-induced stock market crash is unlikely to happen Sadly, there aren’t many good alternatives to domestic shares. Even after a rate increase in December, the 10-year Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.79%  still yields under 2.5%. In Europe, Brexit woes continues to roil markets, and both the DAX DAX, -0.52%  and FTSE 100 UKX, -0.22% have started to run out of gas in the new year. Lastly, while gold GLD, +0.47%   has rallied nicely in the last few weeks, a long-term look at the precious metal will show you plenty of volatility to the downside as gold prices US:GCJ7   remain down about 30% from their 2012 peak. If you’re looking for a risk-free return in 2017, then, you’re out of luck. But if you are increasingly worried about overreliance on U.S. stocks and looking to either hedge your bets or diversify into other areas of opportunity, the landscape is increasingly looking favorable for China stocks SHCOMP, +0.20%  once more. China’s short-term potential, or why bears may be too early The perilous balancing act between China’s short-term growth goals and its risky long-term financial issues is well-documented and not a new concern. After all, this MarketWatch column from the end of 2013 warned of a “hard landing” with the familiar concerns about shadow banking and a credit bubble, and three years later we are still waiting for the other shoe to drop. In this regard, much of the hand-wringing over China stocks resembles warnings about valuation in U.S. stocks — such as this humorous commentary from 2012 warning that U.S. stocks are “fully valued” and that “the stock market in the fall of 2016 is unlikely to be sufficiently higher than where it is today.” For the record, on the date of publication, the S&P was around 1,440. Bears on both China and U.S. equities may simply be too early instead of just plain wrong. However, philosophical victories don’t exactly pay the bills. So if there’s money to be made now, it may be in your best interest to simply take what the market gives while it lasts. Can Giving Up Coal Detoxify the Beijing Sky? For instance, one thing China is giving you in spades right now is a booming middle class. A recent report from the National University of Singapore predicts the Asian middle class population will reach 1.75 billion in 2020, from 500 million in 2010, and says that “Asia is going to add 1.5 times the total population of the West to the global middle class population in one decade.” We are in the very middle of that shift — one that is showing up in everything from another record year for China auto sales in 2016 to a stunning 10.9% jump in December retail sales. To top it off, if you think Western names like Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -3.20%  and Netflix Inc. NFLX, -1.74%  are interesting, you haven’t seen anything yet. After all, China’s internet population just surpassed 730 million after a roughly 6% growth rate last year. That number is more than the entire population of the U.S., Russia, Japan and Germany combined. And yes, while overall growth is slowing, the nation is still expanding at a relatively brisk pace vs. the rest of the world, and one that is well within investor expectations. For calendar 2016, China posted a 6.7% rise in GDP, within the 6.5% to 7% range forecast by Beijing. And most importantly, growth in the final quarter of 2016 accelerated to 6.8% to show promise for 2017. Critics continue to talk about how all this is risky, built on the mirage of government stimulus and unfettered access to credit. However, ratings agency Fitch recently warned of this in the same breath that it noted “continued fund outflows from the mainland were likely to continue to pressure the currency and foreign reserves, that wasn’t likely to be ‘systemically threatening’” to China. Read: What investors are getting all wrong about China, says a top Asian fund manager Will the music stop eventually? Perhaps. However, those sounding the alarm on China’s debt time bomb — or America’s debt time bomb, for that matter — haven’t been proven right just yet. So … what’s the trade? Investing in China, like all emerging markets, can be challenging to U.S. investors thanks to differences in disclosures and limited access to direct investments. The iShares China Large-Cap ETF FXI, -2.17%  is the biggest China ETF with about $3 billion in assets and average volume regularly over 10 million shares. And many investors default to this fund because of its prominent branding and its exposure to the biggies of the region: internet play Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY, -2.58% 0700, +1.33% financial giant China Construction Bank Corp. CICHY, -2.39% 601939, -0.27%  and telecom king China Mobile Ltd. CHL, +0.31% 0941, +2.03% However, the ETF is dangerous because of its lack of diversification; about 27% of the portfolio is concentrated on these three positions, and nearly half of the fund is invested in the financial sector. To top it off, the fund comprises just 51 stocks. For those worried about an eventual financial crisis in China, that’s a risky game to play. A better bet would be the lesser-known SPDR S&P China ETF GXC, -2.52% It too is top-heavy, with three positions representing more than 20% of its portfolio. However, it contains more than 300 investments and is more diversified across sectors; 28% is in information technology, with only 25% in financials and 11% in consumer discretionary plays. Not only is this a better mix since it skews away from finance, but it also skews toward tech and consumer plays that hold so much promise in the near term. Another interesting alternative is the iShares MSCI China Small-Cap ETF ECNS, -2.06% a fund that focuses only on smaller corporations instead of the state-run megacaps you know so well. It doesn’t have a single position worth more than 1.62% of the portfolio, which is good, and is 22% weighted toward consumer discretionary plays and 16% weighted toward information technology. Of course, since these small-caps are mostly unknown and there’s a lot of opacity in Chinese markets, this fund carries plenty of unique risks. However, if you are tired of stretched valuations at home and want a China growth play in the short term, banking on faster-moving small-caps via this fund may be the way to go.

TCEHY	"Intel Corp. is acquiring a 15% stake in Here International B.V. for an undisclosed sum, joining the digital mapmaker's core shareholders BMW AG, Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG's Audi unit in developing navigation technology for self-driving cars. Intel and Here aim to jointly develop technology needed to support the real-time updates of traffic and road conditions that are used to enable and ensure the safety of fully automated vehicles. The companies also said they plan to explore other business opportunities to develop services that use location data generated by the vehicles and their passengers. ""Cars are rapidly becoming some of the world's most intelligent, connected devices,"" Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said Tuesday. The companies gave no details about the transaction. They said the deal was expected to close in the first three months of the year, pending regulatory approval. The announcement comes after Germany's antitrust authority said earlier in the day that Intel had filed a request for regulatory approval in Germany to make a strategic acquisition of a stake in Here. The agency said it had one month to decide on whether to approve the acquisition, which is unlikely to pose competition concerns. Germany's big three premium-brand car makers bought Here from Nokia in 2015 for about EUR2.5 billion ($2.6 billion). Based on the original purchase price, Intel's stake could be worth around EUR375 million. The companies did not disclose any financial details. The German auto makers, which together dominate the global market for high-end luxury cars, set aside decades of bitter rivalry to jointly acquire Here in a bid to control the mapping technology they consider crucial for self-driving vehicles. Intel appears to be positioning itself to enter the fast-growing technology field, marking the latest illustration of how the lines between the tech industry and conventional auto makers are blurring. As the automobile morphs into a platform for digital services with the potential to generate huge profits, auto makers and tech companies are finding common cause or are engaged in fierce rivalries for control of the new mobility economy. ""Intel can help accelerate Here's ambitions in this area by supporting the creation of a universal, always up-to-date digital location platform that spans the vehicle, the cloud and everything else connected,"" said Here CEO Edzard Overbeek. Auto makers are entering such businesses as car-sharing and ride-hailing to capture new revenue streams generated by their vehicles. The car makers want to avoid being left behind because such services could potentially become more lucrative than their traditional businesses. Tech companies such as Uber Technologies Inc., which is essentially an app provider, Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google are challenging the dominance of auto makers including BMW, VW, Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. in providing personal transportation. They are eager to extend their dominance of tech systems, apps and services to the automobile -- just as in the past they moved from the personal computer to the smartphone. New auto technology is driven by information technology, which is why the auto industry has already outpaced computer makers as the single biggest customer for the chip manufacturers such as Intel and Germany's Infineon Technologie AG. Illustrating the trend, U.S. chip-making giant Qualcomm Inc. in October said it would buy Dutch NXP Semiconductors NV, the world's largest developer of chips for automobiles, for $39 billion. Chip makers provide the intelligent sensors and computing power needed to control functions such as projecting information onto the car's display, fuel injection and safety systems. They also provide the eyes of the vehicle that enable cars to ascertain temperature, weather and road conditions, identify other vehicles and objects on the road and allow the vehicle to know its own location. Here is developing a real-time navigation system that creates a 3-D map of the world's roads and allows vehicles to exchange information needed for navigation. The information will be stored on a cloud-based computer network that individual vehicles can access. Intel's interest in taking a stake in Here indicates that chip makers increasingly view the nascent digital-navigation industry as a potential source of new revenue and innovation. The German auto makers are eager to attract strategic investors to Here. Last week, Here said Chinese internet group Tencent Holdings Ltd., Chinese mapping company NavInfo Co. and Singaporean sovereign-wealth fund GIC planned to jointly buy a 10% stake in the company for an undisclosed price. In December, Here unveiled a partnership with Mobileye NV, the Israeli tech company that makes sensors for advanced driver-assistance programs. Here is also close to announcing a partnership in Japan, a key auto market, a person familiar with the situation said. If the Intel acquisition is completed, the Here stake held by the German car makers would fall to about 75%.

The German auto makers, which together dominate the global market for high-end luxury cars, set aside decades of bitter rivalry to jointly acquire Here in a bid to control the mapping technology they consider crucial for self-driving vehicles. Intel appears to be positioning itself to enter the fast-growing technology field, marking the latest illustration of how the lines between the tech industry and conventional auto makers are blurring. As the automobile morphs into a platform for digital services with the potential to generate huge profits, auto makers and tech companies are finding common cause or are engaged in fierce rivalries for control of the new mobility economy. Auto makers are entering new businesses such as car-sharing and ride-hailing to capture new revenue streams generated by their vehicles. The car makers want to avoid being left behind because such services could potentially become more lucrative than their traditional businesses. Tech companies such as Uber Technologies Inc., essentially an app provider, Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google, are challenging the dominance of auto makers including BMW, VW, Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. in providing personal transportation. They are eager to extend their dominance of tech systems, apps and services to the automobile--just as in the past they moved from the personal computer to the smartphone. New auto technology is driven by information technology, which is why the auto industry has already outpaced computer makers as the single biggest customer for the chip manufacturers such as Intel and Germany's Infineon Technologie AG. Illustrating the trend, U.S. chip making giant Qualcomm Inc. in October said it would buy Dutch NXP Semiconductors NV, the world's largest developer of chips for automobiles, for $39 billion. Chip makers provide the intelligent sensors and computing power needed to control functions such as projecting information onto the car's display, fuel injection and safety systems. They also provide the eyes of the vehicle that enable cars to ascertain temperature, weather and road conditions, identify other vehicles and objects on the road and allow the vehicle to know its own location. Here is developing a real-time navigation system that creates a 3-D map of the world's roads and allows vehicles to exchange information needed for navigation. The information will be stored on a cloud-based computer network that individual vehicles can access. Intel's interest in taking a stake in Here indicates that chip makers view the nascent digital-navigation industry as a potential source of new revenue and innovation. When the German auto makers bought Here they said they were eager to add strategic investors. Last week, Here said Chinese internet group Tencent Holdings Ltd., Chinese mapping company NavInfo Co. and Singapore's sovereign-wealth fund GIC planned to jointly buy a 10% stake in the company for an undisclosed price. In December, Here unveiled a partnership with Mobileye NV, the Israeli tech company that makes sensors for advanced driver-assistance programs. The head of Here's automotive business in Asia said in October that the company was looking for a partner in Japan. No deal has been announced yet, but an update could come soon, a person familiar with the situation said. A group of nine Asian auto makers that include Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co. formed the joint venture Dynamic Map Planning Co. in 2016 in a bid to set up a rival to Here.

TCEHY	"Internet services group Tencent Holdings Ltd., NavInfo Co. and Singaporean fund GIC plan to buy a joint 10% stake in digital mapping company HERE from Germany's premium car makers, HERE said on Tuesday. The companies didn't disclose a price. As part of the deal, HERE plans to create a joint venture with Chinese mapping company NavInfo, extending its services to China using NavInfo's data. Tencent, also based in China, will look into using HERE's mapping and location platform services in its own products and services, HERE said. The German car makers that own HERE -- Daimler AG, BMW AG and Volkswagen AG's Audi AG unit -- bought the mapping company from Nokia Corp. last year for roughly 2.5 billion euros ($2.6 billion), aiming to build a platform for autonomous cars that would compete with Alphabet Inc.'s Google. Digital maps will be essential for self-driving cars, which require precise, up-to-date information about a vehicle's surroundings. HERE's services include maps for nearly 200 countries alongside other data, which it provides to the makers of navigation devices and cars as well as websites and apps. ""We...welcome NavInfo and Tencent both as strategic investors who share our vision of the future and as partners with whom we will create attractive new services for the Chinese market,"" HERE Chief Executive Edzard Overbeek said. Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC is a financial investor, he said. The car makers began approaching potential partners soon after buying HERE in mid-2015, and over the past months have said they were in talks with numerous investors to broaden the shareholder base, including Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and other auto makers. HERE wasn't immediately available for further comment. The transaction, subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close in the first half of 2017.

TCEHY	"HONG KONG--Chinese internet major Tencent Holdings Ltd. said third-quarter net profit rose 43% from a year earlier on solid revenue growth from mobile games and advertising. Shenzhen-based Tencent, one of Asia's most valuable technology companies with a market capitalization of roughly $240 billion, generates most of its revenue by distributing games and ads through its popular social-networking platforms such as the WeChat messaging application, which has more than 800 million users. Tencent's quarterly results highlighted the robust performance of smartphone games, which made up for slower growth in revenue from games played on personal computers. To diversify its revenue stream, the company has been beefing up its advertising business by placing more targeted ads on its social-networking platforms, taking a page from Facebook Inc.'s playbook. Revenue from advertising is expected to be a main driver of Tencent's growth over the next few years, along with mobile payments. Tencent said net profit for the three months ended Sept. 30 rose to 10.65 billion yuan ($1.55 billion) from 7.44 billion yuan a year earlier, while revenue jumped 52% to 40.39 billion yuan. Over the past several years, Tencent, the world's largest game publisher by revenue, has expanded its gaming business overseas through acquisitions. Last month, a group of Chinese investors led by Tencent completed an $8.6 billion deal to buy a majority stake in Finland's Supercell Oy, which makes some of the world's highest-grossing mobile games such as ""Clash of Clans"" and ""Clash Royale."" The Supercell deal is structured in a way that the Finnish company won't be consolidated in Tencent's earnings. In the third quarter, Tencent's revenue from smartphone games jumped 87%, boosted by popular titles in China such as the ""Honor of Kings"" battle strategy game. While growth in revenue from games played on personal computers was slower at 10%, the company's overall games revenue grew 27%. While games account for nearly half of Tencent's overall revenue, the company has been trying to earn more revenue from advertising. In the third quarter, Tencent's ad revenue rose 51% from a year earlier. Since last year, Tencent has been placing ads in WeChat's Moments section for photos and updates, similar to Facebook's sponsored posts. In the third quarter, Tencent said WeChat was one of the main contributors to its ad revenue growth. Revenue from performance-based ads, including those placed in WeChat's Moments section, jumped 83% in the quarter. Apart from advertising, another fast-growing business for Tencent is electronic payment. WeChat comes with a mobile wallet function called WeChat Pay, which can be used for various online and offline transactions, from games and movie ticketing to ride hailing. In the third quarter, revenue from the business that includes payments more than quadrupled to 4.96 billion yuan from 1.1 billion yuan a year earlier. In China, the biggest electronic payment service is Alipay, which is operated by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.'s financial affiliate. However, WeChat Pay has been gaining market share over the past year, according to research firms. As of September, Tencent's WeChat messaging platform had 846 million monthly active users, up from 806 million in June.

TCEHY	Chinese e-commerce major JD.com Inc. JD, -2.39% said it was exploring spinning off its internet finance business to facilitate the expansion of the unit in China as it reported a third-quarter loss. JD.com, China's second-largest online retailer, is aiming to selling its whole stake in JD Finance to third-party Chinese investors including its chairman, Richard Liu, the company said Tuesday in a statement. JD's online finance subsidiary would be fully owned by Chinese investors after such a sale, allowing it to expand its operations in certain licensed financial service businesses in mainland China, it said. The Beijing-based company said third-quarter losses had widened by 51% to $121 million from a year ago. Revenue in the third quarter was $9.1 billion, and is expected to be between 75.0 billion and 77.5 billion yuan ($10.9 billion-$11.3 billion) in the fourth quarter, the company said. JD.com is one of several internet companies seeking to tap credit demand among consumers and small and medium-sized businesses in mainland China. JD.com and fellow majors Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, -2.93% and Tencent Holdings Ltd. (0700.HK) have been ramping up efforts to raise funds and expand their payment and digital-banking platforms. Launched in 2013, JD Finance offers a range of financial services and products to consumers and small businesses in China. Last year, it partnered with U.S.-based ZestFinance to provide credit risk evaluation to Chinese companies. In January, JD Finance raised 6.65 billion yuan in financing from investors such as venture-capital firm Sequoia Capital China and China Taiping Insurance. The fund-raising valued the business at 46.65 billion yuan on a fully diluted, postinvestment basis, JD.com said at the time. Mr. Liu, the founder of the online sales platform that sells everything from electronics to apparel, would likely participate in the sale by acquiring a minority stake in JD Finance, JD.com said. Mr. Liu would purchase shares at the same market pricing as other investors and intends to own the majority of the voting rights in the finance unit after the sale, the company said. Nasdaq-listed JD.com said that in a selloff of its JD Finance stake it would receive cash from investors and 40% of any pretax profit from the business on a cumulative basis. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -1.28% owns 10.8% of JD.com shares that don't have extra voting power, the U.S. retailer said in a regulatory filing in October.

TCEHY	"Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. will report third-quarter earnings on Wednesday. China's biggest social network and online games company, which operates the popular WeChat mobile messaging application, is expected to report that its net profit rose 46% from a year earlier, according to analysts' estimates. EARNINGS FORECAST Tencent is expected to report that its net profit for the three months ended Sept. 30 rose to 10.87 billion yuan ($1.59 billion) from 7.45 billion yuan a year earlier, according to analysts polled by S&P Capital IQ. REVENUE FORECAST Revenue likely rose 48% to 39.28 billion yuan from 26.6 billion yuan a year earlier, according to the poll. WHAT TO WATCH ADVERTISING REVENUE Analysts and investors are counting on online advertising as the main driver of Tencent's revenue growth over the next few years. In the second quarter, advertising accounted for about 18% of Tencent's revenue. Given that global social network giant Facebook Inc. earns almost all of its revenue from ads, analysts say there is still plenty of room for Tencent to expand its advertising business, particularly through WeChat, which has more than 800 million monthly active users. To cash in on WeChat's popularity, Tencent has been expanding display ads on the app's timeline page similar to Facebook Inc.'s sponsored posts. MOBILE GAMES REVENUE While advertising revenue has been growing fast, Tencent's biggest source of revenue is still online games. In the second quarter, the company generated nearly half of its revenue from games. Robust growth in mobile games has been making up for a slowdown in games played on personal computers. But analysts also note that Tencent faces intensifying competition in China's mobile games market, where the company faces formidable rivals such as NetEase Inc. SUPERCELL ACQUISITION A consortium of investors led by Tencent recently completed the $8.6 billion acquisition of a majority stake in Supercell Oy, the Finnish maker of some of the world's most popular mobile games such as ""Clash of Clans"" and ""Clash Royale."" The deal is structured in a way that Supercell wouldn't be consolidated in Tencent's earnings. But in the coming years, investors and analysts are expecting Tencent to benefit from the acquisition, both as the biggest shareholder of Supercell and as a distributor of the Finnish company's games in China. MOBILE PAYMENTS Apart from advertising, mobile payments is another potential source of Tencent's long-term growth. In China, the company is locked in a fierce battle with market leader Alipay, an electronic payment service operated by the financial affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Tencent is gaining ground thanks to the growth of WeChat's built-in mobile wallet function, WeChat Pay. In the first quarter, Tencent's share of China's mobile-payment market more than tripled to 38% from a year earlier, while Alipay's share fell to 52% from 79%, according to iResearch.

TCEHY	"FRANKFURT-Audi AG (NSU.XE), the premium brand of Volkswagen AG (VOW.XE), said on Sunday it has signed memorandums of understanding with three technology giants in China aimed at enhancing the development of connected cars within Audi's largest regional market. The three separate MoUs that Audi China signed with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA Baidu Inc. BIDU and Tencent Holdings Ltd.

Audi and Alibaba already cooperate on integrating real-time traffic data and high-resolution 3D maps. From 2017 onward, Audi will launch Baidu CarLife apps in its local models. Audi and Tencent currently develop the integration of WeChat MyCar services into Audi models, starting with location-sharing and music-sharing services. FAW-Volkswagen Automotive Co.

TCEHY	"SHANGHAI-- Volkswagen AG is exploring a joint venture to make electric cars in China with a state-run company, part of its aggressive push into electric-vehicle production as the auto maker works to resolve its emissions cheating scandal. The German car maker has signed a memorandum of cooperation with China Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co. for a potential partnership, the companies said in separate statements. Jianghuai said the companies will share equal ownership of the joint venture, and are aiming for a formal agreement within five months. ""As we aim to be at the forefront of e-mobility, Volkswagen Group is looking forward to explore all options to set up a close and mutually beneficial partnership with JAC,"" said Matthias Müller, chairman of Volkswagen Group. The company is targeting sales of 1 million electric vehicles a year world-wide by 2025. Volkswagen, which derives more than a third of its global vehicle sales from China after three decades of operations there, currently has two car-making partners in the country: SAIC Motor Co. in Shanghai and FAW Group Co. in the northeast. Under government rules, foreign car makers must tie up with local partners to produce cars. China limits foreign auto companies to two local partners to make gasoline-powered vehicles. While the limit doesn't apply to electric cars, most foreign companies choose to produce alternative-energy vehicles with their existing partners. Officials at SAIC and FAW didn't respond to requests for comment. Analysts say Volkswagen may be able to strike a more favorable deal with Jianghuai than its current partners. ""You may get a better agreement from a company who values your technology more. SAIC and FAW may already have [electric-vehicle] technologies and do not need VW as much as JAC,"" said Bill Russo, a Shanghai-based managing director at consultancy Gao Feng Advisory Co. General Motors Co. plans to launch about 10 alternative-energy cars with its Chinese partners, SAIC and Wuling, by 2020. Nissan Motor Co. and its partner, Dongfeng Motor Group Co., launched an all-electric car in China in 2014. Wednesday's announcement follows Volkswagen's purchase of a 16.6% stake in U.S.-based truck maker Navistar International Corp. this week. Jianghuai, of Hefei in east China's Anhui province, is a major truck maker in China. It also builds conventional and electric cars. Earlier this year, Jianghuai signed a 10 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) agreement with NextEV Co., an electric-car startup backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Sequoia Capital, to develop electric vehicles. China is going all in on alternative-energy vehicles, as it seeks to cut dependence on oil imports and reduce air pollution. Beijing also regards electric cars as a shortcut for its companies to reach the forefront of an evolving global auto industry. Chinese governments at all levels last year spent a total of 90 billion yuan ($14 billion) in the sector, including direct cash subsidies for electric-vehicle makers and construction of public charging stations, says UBS Securities. Sales of electric and hybrid cars and buses quadrupled in 2015 from the previous year to 331,000 vehicles. In the first seven months of this year, sales of such vehicles rose 23% to 207,000 units. Volkswagen's current strategy review calls for accelerating development of electric vehicles. Over the next decade, Volkswagen plans to develop around 30 new battery electric-car models, which could account for as much as 25% of the car maker's total sales. The company has said it expects to launch the first fully autonomous vehicles by the end of the decade.

TCEHY	"JOHANNESBURG -- Steinhoff International Holdings NV, Africa's retailing giant but little-known outside the continent, has made its first foray into the U.S., agreeing to pay $2.4 billion for Sleepy's owner Mattress Firm Holding Corp. Steinhoff, a family-owned furniture seller based outside Cape Town, South Africa, is called ""Africa's Ikea"" for its home furnishing retail chains. Until recently, it has trained its sights on expansion in Europe, from Germany and Switzerland to Poland and Bulgaria, and Australasia. Last month, it agreed to pay GBP597 million ($793.77 million) for British retailer Poundland Group PLC, which sells most of its goods for a pound, or about $1.31 at today's rates. The company said on Sunday it would push into the U.S., as well, acquiring Mattress Firm for $64 a share in cash. The offer represents a 115% premium to Mattress Firm's closing price Friday of $29.74. Steinhoff described the deal as one that would ""create the world's largest multi-brand mattress retail distribution network."" Houston-based Mattress Firm, meanwhile, is the largest U.S. specialty mattress retailer with 3,500 company-operated and franchised stores in 48 states and sells a variety of brands including Tempur-Pedic and Sealy. Founded in 1986, it too has been expanding through acquisitions, including the purchase of rival Sleepy's in February. The expansion has bolstered sales but also resulted in rising costs. Mattress Firm warned in June that it expected a loss for the fiscal year as it moved to rebrand all its stores under the Mattress Firm banner. Bruno Steinhoff, the Steinhoff family patriarch, started his business selling cheap furniture from West Germany to East Germans in 1964. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 put Mr. Steinhoff in a position to tap a growing consumer class in Eastern Europe. In 1997, the family acquired a stake in a South African furniture company, listing the combined entity on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in 1998 under its current name. Steinhoff owns a variety of chains that sell furniture and bedding in countries ranging from Switzerland to Poland. Steinhoff has since been looking to tap markets further afield. ""In South Africa and Africa, our market-share is already quite big. Growth potential in our current product category is a bit capped,"" said Mariza Nel, director of corporate services at Steinhoff, in an interview before the Mattress Firm deal. ""We need the market to grow, or we will need to enter into a new product category."" For the nine months ended March 31, the company -- which recently moved its primary stock listing to Frankfurt -- posted a 45% increase in revenue to EUR9.93 billion, while operating profit rose 46% to EUR1.09 billion. Many of South Africa's companies have found success tapping developed markets like Australia, rather than tackling developing but difficult ones in Africa, despite the continent's population of more than one billion people. In Nigeria, Africa's largest economy, for example, rents are exorbitant and supply chains tough to maintain. Upscale South African food and clothing retailer Woolworths Holdings Ltd. closed its three Nigerian stores in late 2013. Months later, it acquired Australian department-store chain David Jones and the remaining minority stake in specialty apparel maker Country Road Group. The company now reaps more than 40% of its revenue from Australasia. Naspers Ltd., Africa's largest company by market capitalization, catapulted to that position after acquiring an early stake in China's Tencent Holdings Ltd., now an internet giant. Naspers is Tencent's biggest stakeholder, and has investments in internet companies from Argentina to India to Turkey. Steinhoff isn't leaving Africa. Last year, it bought South African clothing discounter Pepkor Holdings Proprietary Ltd. for 62.8 billion South African rand, about $5.7 billion at the time. The combined entity currently has more than 6,500 stores in 30 countries across Africa, Europe and Australasia. Still, during the six months ended Dec. 31, Africa, excluding South Africa, accounted for less than 2% of Steinhoff's revenue. Like many multinationals with South African roots, it retains a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, where it is the eighth biggest company, with a market capitalization of 346.08 billion South African rand ($25.26 billion). Others include mining behemoth Anglo American PLC, luxury-goods giant Cie. Financière Richemont SA and SABMiller PLC. Just three of the Johannesburg exchange's 10 largest companies by market cap have primary listings there. SABMiller's precursor, South African Breweries, moved its headquarters from Johannesburg to the U.K. in 1999 amid a wave of corporate defections. Then as now, a weak currency and limited access to international investors hobbled the country's economy. Steinhoff's deal with Mattress Firm is expected to close in the third quarter. Linklaters LLP acted as legal counsel to Steinhoff, and Ropes & Gray LLP acted as legal counsel to Mattress Firm. Mattress Firm's financial adviser for the transaction was Barclays.

TCEHY	"HONG KONG--U.K.-based chip designer ARM Holdings PLC confirmed Monday that it agreed to a buyout offer worth more than $32 billion from SoftBank Group Corp., marking a significant push for the Japanese telecommunications giant into the mobile internet. The all-cash deal comes on the heels of SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son's decision to take back the reins of the company's investment strategy from his former deputy and designated successor, Nikesh Arora, who resigned in June. ""ARM will be an excellent strategic fit within the SoftBank group as we invest to capture the very significant opportunities provided by the 'Internet of Things,'"" Mr. Son said. ""This is one of the most important acquisitions we have ever made, and I expect ARM to be a key pillar of SoftBank's growth strategy going forward,"" he said. ARM's shares rose as much as 45% in Monday morning trading in London. The Japanese company said it would double employee head count in the region over the next five years. It also plans to increase head count outside the U.K. SoftBank, an internet and telecommunications conglomerate that invests in online startups from India to China and owns mobile carriers in Japan and the U.S., has been raising cash in recent months to bolster its war chest and pay down debt. Big deals have included the sale of around $10 billion worth of shares in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and the sale of its entire stake in Finnish game maker Supercell Oy to China's Tencent Holdings Ltd. That deal valued Supercell at more than $10 billion, and is expected to bring in more than $7 billion for SoftBank. The ARM deal also comes less than a month after the U.K.'s decision to exit the European Union, a move that pushed down the value of the pound. That has made British companies potentially more attractive for buyers from overseas. But it also comes after a rally in ARM shares after the June 23 vote. ARM has very little sales in Britain itself. In a press conference Monday in London, Mr. Son said he wasn't affected by Brexit considerations and had only met ARM's chairman for the first time two weeks ago--and after the Brexit vote. Brexit ""didn't affect my decision"" on pursuing ARM, he said. He said the recent drop in the pound after Britain's referendum last month ""did not bring us any discount."" Philip Hammond, Britain's Treasury chief, said early Monday he welcomed the deal in a statement. Mr. Son said he told Mr. Hammond that he would keep ARM based in England. About 1,600 of ARM's 4,000-employee force is based in the U.K. Mr. Son said he pledged to British officials that he would double ARM's U.K.-based workforce over the next five years. Cambridge, U.K.-based ARM, whose microchip designs dominate the global processor market for smartphones including Apple Inc.'s iPhone, boasts a strong portfolio of intellectual property for chips connecting mobile devices. While less vibrant demand for smartphones has weighed on ARM's recent results, SoftBank is betting that its technology will be crucial to connecting devices ranging from smartphones to automobiles and appliances, according to a person familiar with the matter. SoftBank also controls Sprint Corp. and has been cutting expenses to revive the No. 4 U.S. mobile carrier. SoftBank started more than three decades ago as a software distributor and has undergone many metamorphoses since then. At one time, it owned a magazine publisher and operated trade shows. In the 2000s, Mr. Son used a series of acquisitions to turn SoftBank into one of Japan's three major telecommunications companies, and its Japanese mobile-phone operator remains the company's cash cow. He added to his telecommunications holdings by taking a controlling stake in Sprint of the U.S., then veered into internet services with investments in Asian e-commerce companies and ride-sharing apps.

TCEHY	"Wow. The market changed quite a bit since the release of the FOMC minutes two weeks ago. On that day, we discovered that our Fed had suddenly gone from dovish to hawkish. On that day, the U.S. dollar halted its downward trend and began going up once again. On that day, gold halted its upward trend and began going down once again. Things have really changed. But have they changed for the better or the worse? The bottom line in the changing stance by the Fed is that on that day they endorsed our current economy. They do not even see a hint of a recession looming on the horizon. Keep in mind that it will be a recession that will eventually lead us into the next bear market. So, if the Fed feels confident enough to start tightening monetary policy, they must also be fairly confident about the current state of our economy. The story is in the stocks Is this not good news for the stock market? The stock market feeds off of a growing economy. If the Fed sees a growing economy ahead, don't they also see a growing stock market? Judging by the reaction of the market since the FOMC minutes were released, the market sure is thinking that way. On the surface, you may not think that there has been much significance to the moves that the market has made since those FOMC minutes. But as someone who dives down deep, for eight to 10 hours into the market on a daily basis, I have witnessed a lot of action that was downright eye popping. Dollar Tree Did you see the extreme breakout in a ""risk-on"" stock like Dollar Tree DLTR, -0.28% ? I sure did. Those are new all-time highs that you are seeing above. Dollar Tree was one of those ""I didn't know that"" discoveries that I made when I was inventing my Best Stocks Now App back in 2008. I mean, really, a company that sells mostly off-brand, sometimes damaged, and even cheap trinket-like merchandise is one of the best performers in the market over the last decade? See for yourself... Data from Best Stocks Now app Data from Best Stocks Now app The returns of Dollar Tree's stock have blown away the returns of the market over the last one, three, five and 10 years. In cheap trinkets I do believe. I guess this is one area of retail in which Amazon AMZN, -3.20%  can’t destroy the competition. How much does it cost to pack and ship a one-dollar trinket? Besides that, I want to hold and feel a trinket in my hand before I plunk down my hard-earned dollar. I wrote about why Amazon is one of my biggest positions last week. Dollar Tree is currently my fourth largest position. Adobe Did you see the breakout in Adobe ADBE, -2.21%  last week? I sure did. I wrote about why Adobe is also one of my largest positions last August. I did a three-minute evaluation of its current valuation this past week on my daily national radio show. How many large-cap tech stocks are expected to grow their earnings by 37% this year and 33% next year? Not many. In fact, stocks like Cisco CSCO, -2.61% Microsoft MSFT, -2.33%  and Apple AAPL, -2.56%  have dwindled down to just single-digit growth. No thanks. I recently wrote about another large-cap tech stock that I believe is the new king of growth in this space. Intuit Did you notice the breakout in Intuit INTU, -2.42%  this past week? This is another large holding at Gunderson Capital Management. These are obviously all ""risk-on"" stocks that we are looking at so far. They have been going sideways since last summer. Now they are all of a sudden lifting off once again. I did a three-minute evaluation of Intuit on my radio shows this past week. Tencent Holdings This sudden action is not limited to just U.S. stocks, however. Another one of my large holdings is Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY, -2.58%   It is one of China's largest internet stocks. Tencent, like Dollar Tree, Adobe and Intuit also broke out this past week. It looks like I will be doing a feature of this stocks on one of my upcoming radio show. Equinix A technology-related REIT named Equinix EQIX, -1.58%  is also busting loose one again. This is also one of my largest holdings. I wrote all about it back in February. Visa The financial sector is also liking the new hawkish clothes that Ms. Yellen is wearing once again. One of my favorites continues to be Visa V, -2.88% It is also a holding here at my money-management firm. It is articles and picks like these that have placed me in the top 15% of all financial experts according to tipranks.com. Why now? One would really not expect the stock market to react in such a positive way after the FOMC minutes showed that they had turned hawkish once again. There are several reasons for this. By going hawkish, the Fed endorsed the economy and the growth thereof. They are now more confident that the economy, both domestic and global, is now on solid enough ground to be able to absorb future rate hikes. By endorsing the growth of the economy, the Fed also endorsed the stock market in an indirect way. If you do not believe this, go back and review the charts above. It will be a recession that will finally end this seven-year-old-plus bull market. The Fed obviously does not see one out there on the horizon for now, neither do I. Lastly, earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to return to growth in the second half of this year. That second half begins in about four weeks. The big leveling off in earnings over the last two years has been caused, for the most part, by earnings in the oil patch going negative during that time. Now oil has rebounded to almost $50 per barrel and earnings expectations are finally rising once again as opposed to falling. My weekly newsletter gave a buy signal back in late March of 2009. I am a market timer, not a buy-and-holder or an asset allocator. My newsletter will eventually give a sell signal, but for now we need to continue to make hay while the sun is shining.

TCEHY	"Tencent Holdings Ltd. warned of possible challenges to its ad business due to China's economic slowdown, despite the Chinese Internet giant posting strong earnings growth for the first quarter thanks to solid revenue from mobile games and advertising. The Shenzhen-based company, which operates the WeChat and QQ messaging and social-networking applications, said net profit for the three months through March rose to 9.18 billion yuan ($1.41 billion) from 6.88 billion yuan a year earlier. Its revenue rose 43% to 32 billion yuan. The company's business model of distributing games and ads through its popular WeChat and QQ apps has so far translated to revenue growth. Its revenue from online games-- its biggest source of revenue--grew 28% to 17.09 billion yuan, boosted by smartphone games such as the mobile version of ""CrossFire,"" a top-grossing game previously released for personal computers. Tencent's games are free to play, but they generate revenue by charging players for better virtual weapons and other additional features. To create a new source of revenue, Tencent has been expanding its advertising business on its social networks, following in the footsteps of Facebook Inc., which has built a successful ad platform. For example, Tencent last year started placing brand ads in WeChat's Moments section, where users post photos and updates. In the first quarter, Tencent's advertising revenue jumped 73% to 4.7 billion yuan. About 80% of its ad revenue was generated by mobile platforms, the company said. Ad-revenue growth, however, slowed from the fourth quarter, when it more than doubled from the previous year. Tencent said in its earnings release Wednesday that its brand-advertising business ""could face near-term challenges due to the uncertainties of [the] macroeconomic environment in China."" The ability of WeChat and QQ to retain users is crucial for Tencent's continued revenue growth. As of March, WeChat had 762 million monthly active users, up from 697 million in December, the company said. Active users of QQ's mobile app rose to 658 million from 642 million over the same period. Tencent executives have said that the company is building an ""ecosystem"" by connecting WeChat and QQ with a wide range of services that cover online shopping to ride-hailing and food deliveries. So far, Tencent has invested in a number of Chinese companies, including ride-sharing app Didi Chuxing Technology Co. and group-buying service Meituan-Dianping, linking their services with its apps.

TCEHY	Chinese retail sales, industrial production and capital investment were weaker than economists had expected, emboldening the gloom-and-doom crowd. But investors largely shrugged off the news, as other reports late last week served as a foreshadowing. The big picture is that Chinese consumers are in good shape, and this bodes well for China, say analysts. “Underlying consumption demand remains healthy,” says Britney Lam, investment strategist with Macquarie Investment Management, which runs the Delaware Asia Select Fund US:DMAAX Chinese consumer prices are being driven up by strong demand, she says. And property sales grew 60% from January through April, by value. “This reflects price and volume growth that is demand-driven and has been broad-based across 40 key cities,” she says. The bottom line: “We continue to favor domestic demand and local consumption and services in China and Asia markets,” says Lam. In short, there’s a key megatrend in Asia that often gets lost amid all the China naysaying. Thanks to regular, healthy jobs and income gains, Chinese consumers have lots of spending power, and they use it. Chinese wanderlust One way to play this megatrend is to buy shares of China-based retailers, of course. But increasingly, Chinese consumers love to travel and spend money abroad. So that sets up another approach: Buy shares of companies in countries near China, the ones that get a boost from spending by Chinese tourists. Outbound tourism from China grew by almost a third last year. “It’s a real growth phenomenon,” says Sam Le Cornu, who also helps manage the Delaware Asia Select Fund. Chinese tourists regularly jam airports in nearby countries during peak travel season. Then once they get out and about, they readily open up their wallets. On average, Chinese tourists spend $2,000 per trip, says Lam. Big picture, Chinese travelers spent $215 billion last year, an increase of 53% compared with 2014, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council. Le Cornu and Lam think Chinese spending abroad will grow rapidly over the next several years for the following reasons. 1. Wage growth in China is quite healthy. After inflation, wages have been growing about 10% a year for the past 10 years, says Lam. 2. Next, state pension reform is on the way, which should see the government build out its social security system. Why does this matter? The Chinese are great savers. They have about $10 trillion worth of savings in bank accounts, says Le Cornu. “That, for us, is very interesting. What if consumers go out and start spending that $10 trillion?” They just might, and here’s why: One of the reasons they save so much is that China’s social security system is pretty limited. But Le Cornu expects China will beef it up. “If there is pension reform, consumers will have the confidence to spend that money,” he says. 3. The fund managers also expect a big increase in the number of people with passports over the next several years as China aligns with global trends. The number of Chinese with passports is still relatively low at about 4%, compared with almost 40% in the U.S. Reverse China plays The fund managers prefer to tap into Chinese consumer strength and wanderlust via what they call “reverse China plays.” This means companies outside of China that benefit. Key destinations of Chinese tourists include South Korea, Japan and Thailand, so that’s where you find these companies. Le Cornu and Lam like to focus on relatively easy-to-understand businesses with strong cash flow, in areas like retail, food, cosmetics and infrastructure. This way, there’s no need to make a call on Chinese banks or property companies, or have a view on commodity prices. “Simple businesses with good cash flow, earnings, and strong corporate governance are key,” says Lam. The fund owns several Asian consumer-facing companies that are unlisted on U.S. exchanges, or thinly traded over-the-counter issues here. For example, top holdings include Hyundai Department Store in Seoul; Korea Kolmar, which sells cosmetics that are popular among Chinese consumers; and Airports of Thailand. Unless you have a brokerage account that gives you access to Asian exchanges, you’ll have to buy the fund to get exposure to those names. But the fund also owns several names you can readily buy here as domestic consumer plays inside China. The fund counts China Mobile CHL, +0.31% and Tencent Holdings TCEHY, -2.58% which offers games, messaging and online advertising services among top holdings. And while Coach US:COH  doesn’t appear as a fund holding, its products are popular in China and among Chinese tourists travelling outside of China. So much so that Coach hires Mandarin-speaking sales staff in stores outside China. Risks Of course, buying stocks that benefit from Chinese tourism and consumer strength has its risks. Successful investors like Stanley Druckenmiller have raised a red flag about debt levels in China for years. He repeated the theme at this year’s Sohn Investment Conference in early May. “Credit has expanded too fast and non-performing loans will increase a lot,” agrees a native Chinese fund manager based in Philadelphia — who asked to remain anonymous because of concerns about possible fallout, when he goes back on trips, for speaking negatively about his homeland. China has been expanding credit even more, recently, to try to spur growth. “To increase debt just makes the longer-term problem worse,” he says. And Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates even cites looming problems in China as one of the reasons he is betting on a decline in a South Africa-based telecom company called MTN Group MTNOY, -2.07% In other words, things are going to get so bad in China, it will have reverberations elsewhere, he says. That’s pretty bad. Chanos predicts African economies will suffer as further economic weakness in China reduces Chinese investments in African natural-resource development. “China is pulling back from Africa,” says Chanos. Lam acknowledges there are risks in the potential deterioration of credit quality in China. This explains why her fund is underweight its Asian market benchmark, which happens to be full of Chinese banks, state-owned businesses and companies in steel, cement and manufacturing. “We are cautious about the over-leverage on this side of the economy. We are the most underweight in eight years,” she says. “But we are very optimistic on the other side of the economy, which is the consumer. Our focus is on the consumer.” Lam thinks the government still has enough policy tools to solve problems that arise, and that low interest rates after a series of rate cuts last year should help with growth. Lam thinks India is a greater risk for investors because valuations are so rich there. “India looks expensive while earnings estimates are getting revised down. It is difficult to find a lot of value in India at the moment. We have been patient for prices to come down, and we are still being patient.” One exception is HDFC Bank HDB, -1.90% which trades in the U.S. as an ADR. HDFC is one of the largest banks in India that is not owned by the government. At the time of publication, Michael Brush had no positions in any stocks mentioned in this column.

TCEHY	"Apple Inc. is betting $1 billion on China's homegrown competitor to Uber Technologies Inc., marking the technology giant's largest investment in a critical market at a time when its global fortunes are flagging. The investment in Didi Chuxing Technology Co., announced late Thursday in California, came on the day that Apple briefly ceded its spot as the world's most valuable company to Google parent Alphabet Inc., a lingering effect of a quarterly earnings announcement that spooked investors about Apple's future. Among the worrying signs from its earnings report last month were indications of slowing sales in China where Apple had been posting booming sales. Didi Chuxing -- which investors are valuing at over $25 billion, making it one of China's most valuable startups -- is locked in a fierce battle with UberChina to attract riders and investors in China's ride-share market. Apple declined to elaborate on the motivation for the deal. However, the company has been working on building an autonomous electric vehicle with a team of more than 1,000 employees. Other ride-sharing services have shown an interest in autonomous vehicles. Uber has a large team of employees working on autonomous vehicle technology, while General Motors and Lyft are planning to start testing a fleet of self-driving taxis within a year. The investment in Didi is an unusual one for Apple, which tends to prefer to buy small startups outright and absorb their technology into its product pipeline. This is the largest investment for Apple since it acquired headphones and streaming music service Beats Electronics for $3 billion in 2014, a deal that helped the company launch its Apple Music service. It is also unusual for Apple to participate in a fund-raising round for a startup. The $1 billion investment barely makes a dent in the company's cash holdings of $233 billion. The investment could encourage the adoption of its Apple Pay and other services in China, although the announcement didn't elaborate on cooperation plans between the two sides. As its second-largest market for iPhones, China is a key market for Apple. Apple Pay was launched in China in February, and it is vying against China's leading mobile payment services from Internet giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. But Apple has come up against some regulatory challenges in China. Apple's online book and movie services were suspended by Chinese regulators in the country last month, as the country cracks down on online media, according to people familiar with the discussions. There has so far been no resolution. Apple sales to Greater China, which the company designates to include Taiwan and Hong Kong, rose 84% in the past fiscal year ended September 2015, as sales of its larger-screen iPhone surged. But as the Chinese economy started to slow, Apple's sales in the country also took a hit. In the quarter ended March, Apple said sales to the region fell 26% from a year earlier. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook, who has worked hard to build strong relationships in China with regular trips to the country, last month said he was more optimistic about the country's economy. China may not provide the huge growth that it once did, Mr. Cook said at the time, but ""it's a lot more stable than what I think is the common view of it."" Recently, Mr. Cook has also said that Apple won't be afraid to use its balance sheet to its advantage at a time when asset values are declining, especially among start-ups which are starting to face challenges in fund-raising. Didi is part of the country's boom of Internet service apps racing to build scale through subsidies. Its expansion has been fueled mainly by investments from Internet giants and investment firms so far. It is new for a maker of highly profitable hardware to invest in the sector. ""Didi exemplifies the innovation taking place in the iOS developer community in China,"" said Mr. Cook in a statement. ""We are extremely impressed by the business they've built and their excellent leadership team, and we look forward to supporting them as they grow."" The deal came together quickly. Didi President Jean Liu said she met with Mr. Cook in Cupertino, Calif., on April 20 and hammered out the agreement in the weeks since. ""We are very confident we will benefit each other on product, on technology and on many other levels,"" Ms. Liu said on a call with reporters Friday. She declined to give further details or confirm if Apple Pay or autonomous cars will be areas of collaboration. For Didi, the deal -- which is its single largest investment so far -- is a coup that adds Apple to its roster of investors that already include the two largest Internet companies in China: e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding and social-and-gaming company Tencent Holdings. The two Chinese Internet giants had supported rival taxi-hailing services that merged to form Didi. In China's fast-growing market for ride-sharing, both Didi and UberChina are providing huge subsidies to drivers and riders to sign up for their services. While many global startups including some in Silicon Valley have had difficulty raising money amid a slowdown in the global economy, Didi has been an exception. Its valuation has soared from just $6 billion in February 2015 when it was formed from the combination of two competing taxi-hailing companies. Investors are betting that the company will be able to eventually turn a profit after attracting more Chinese riders to its service. Didi dominates the country's taxi-hailing market, and has a larger share than UberChina in the private-car-hailing segment, though the two companies disagree on the exact figures. Didi has expanded its private-car services to compete more directly against Uber, while adding other services such as buses and chauffeurs who drive customers' own vehicles. As of January, Didi was operating in more than 400 cities in China. UberChina, which operates in more than 45 cities currently in China, aims to expand to 100 cities in China by the end of this year. --Eva Dou in Beijing contributed to this article.

TCEHY	Some prominent hedge fund managers on Thursday offered up their “best ideas” in a panel discussion at the SALT hedge fund conference in Las Vegas. Here’s a quick rundown of the highlights: John Lykouretzos, founder of Hoplite Capital Management, deemed American Airlines AAL, -3.55%   the “most compelling short in the U.S. airline industry.” In his presentation, Lykouretzos, a former protege of hedge-fund legend Julian Robertson, pushed back against the popular notion that a wave of mergers has created an “oligopoly” in the airline industry. It’s true that airlines are in the seventh year of a long “up” cycle that has seen margins climb to around 20%. But Lykouretzos expects margins to normalize and trough in coming years. He expects airlines to again build excess capacity, while labor costs are likely to rise as labor unions demand a larger share of profits. A further rebound in oil prices could remove the tailwind provided by low fuel costs, he said. American is particularly vulnerable, he said, because it has a relatively high costs structure, is the most exposed to rising oil, offers the weakest free cash flow generation and is the most highly leveraged of the four major carriers. While shares can rally in the short term, he sees the trade playing out over 18 to 36 months. John Burbank of Passport Capital highlighted a China-focused pair trade, going long Chinese media, Internet and mobile-phone company Tencent Holdings Limited TCEHY, -2.58%  and shorting the iShares China Large-Cap FXI, -2.17%  exchange traded fund. Burbank said Tencent offers the dominant social media platform. The firm owns six of the top 10 smartphone apps in China, he said, and also represents a “call option” on the payments business, which has seen many Chinese “leapfrogging” traditional credit cards to make payments via Tencent and Alibaba instead. Burbank said Tencent’s stock has been going sideways due to macro risks tied to China and fears of further yuan devaluation. The short position on FXI is a way to hedge country risk, Burbank said, calling the ETF a play on “Old China.” FXI is made up 52% of financials, 13% energy, 12% telecom and 7% industrials. A devaluation impacts “old China” more, Burbank said, while firms like Tencent will be little fazed. Renowned short seller James Chanos of Kynikos Associates reiterated his short position on liquid natural-gas exporter Cheniere Energy LNG, -3.29%  , criticizing what he said was the firm’s complex holding-company structure and deeming it “crazy expensive” compared to its peers. The short call pits Chanos against billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who has a large stake in Cheniere. Asked by the moderator what he sees that Icahn doesn’t, Chanos said: “You would have to ask him.” Richard Chilton of Chilton Investment Company made a long-term case for Sherwin Williams SHW, -2.80%   , noting he’d bought the paint maker seven years ago. Chilton praised the company’s proposed $9.3 billion acquisition of Valspar US:VAL  as a great match that pairs two companies with good metrics in a solid business.

TCEHY	"in New York Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. said Thursday its fiscal fourth quarter net profit surged 86% from a year earlier, boosted by disposal gains on investments and businesses. Alibaba said net profit for the three months ended March 31 rose to 5.37 billion yuan (US$832 million) from 2.89 billion yuan a year earlier. Revenue rose 39% to 24.18 billion yuan from 17.43 billion, beating analysts' expectations of 23.2 billion yuan. Gross merchandise volume -- a key metric that determines the growth rate of e-commerce companies -- fell to 742 billion yuan at the end of March from 964 billion yuan at the end of December, which included Alibaba's biggest retail day, Singles Day. That number includes shipping costs and confirmed, but not successfully closed, orders. Mobile GMV accounted for 73% of total GMV, up from 51% a year earlier. Despite robust revenue growth, Alibaba continues to face headwinds. Competitor JD.com Inc. has been gaining market share, with its revenue growth outpacing Alibaba for the past six quarters. At the same time, Alibaba continues to throw money at deals such as its recent $1 billion investment in Southeast Asian e-commerce startup Lazada Group and its $266 million purchase of Hong Kong-based newspaper South China Morning Post. Some investors have questioned how several of the e-commerce giant's tie-ups fit into the company's overall strategy and it also continues to face criticism on its handling of counterfeit goods on its platforms. ""Competition may have an impact on the company's growth,"" said Henry Guo, an analyst at ITG Investment Research, referring to Alibaba's ventures into on-demand services such as food delivery and travel. Shares in the company added 4.9% premarket to $79.50. The stock had fallen 4.7% over the past year amid concerns of an economic slowdown in China. Despite those concerns, Alibaba has seen growth in sales and number of users, and online shopping has remained resilient through the first quarter, analysts at Nomura Securities said in a recent note. ""We showcase resiliency and growing clout of Chinese consumers,"" Maggie Wu, chief financial officer, said in a statement. During the quarter, growth in China's rural landscape increased, with Alibaba having a presence in more than 14,000 rural villages, up from 12,000 villages during the previous quarter. Cross-border imports continued to help transaction volume on Tmall Global, with more than 100 international brands, including Costco and Macy's, bringing goods to Chinese consumers, Alibaba said. The company also made strides in cloud computing business, with revenue increasing to 1.1 billion yuan, up 175% year over year. Alibaba said it repurchased and canceled 5.8 million shares for about $365 million in the fourth quarter.

TCEHY	Chinese Internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. (0700.HK) said its net profit grew 22% in the fourth quarter, helped by its solid online-games business and a surge in advertising revenue. The Shenzhen-based company said its net profit for three months ended Dec. 31 rose to 7.16 billion yuan ($1.10 billion) from 5.86 billion yuan a year earlier. Revenue increased 45% to 30.44 billion yuan, from 20.98 billion yuan a year earlier. In the quarter, Tencent's revenue from online games--its biggest source of revenue--grew 33% to 15.97 billion yuan, thanks to strong demand for smartphone games. But the company recorded faster growth in its online advertising revenue, which more than doubled from a year earlier to 5.73 billion yuan from 2.63 billion yuan. Tencent's ad revenue accounted for 19% of its total revenue for the quarter, up from 13% a year earlier. Tencent has built success as China's biggest online-games company and the operator of the WeChat and QQ messaging and social-networking applications. As the market for online games matures after years of explosive growth, the company is scrambling to create a new engine for growth by pushing further into advertising. Investors say they are counting on Tencent's ability to build a lucrative ad business on top of its social platforms by taking a page from Facebook Inc.'s (FB) playbook. Tencent, which launched WeChat in 2011 and kept it ad-free for years, began experimenting with some banner ads in 2014. Last year, it started showing ads on the app's Facebook-like Moments section where users see their friends' updates and photos. In February, the company opened up WeChat's Moments to effectively all advertisers by making it possible to apply for ad slots online, taking another step toward creating a broader ad platform. Previously, WeChat mostly worked with major brands by negotiating sizable ad deals individually. Because WeChat is already so widespread in China and adding more users will likely become harder, Tencent needs to figure out how to make more money off the platform, investors say. In the fourth quarter, WeChat had 697 million monthly active users, up from 650 million in the previous quarter, Tencent said.

TCEHY	"Chinese e-commerce company JD.com Inc. said its loss widened in its latest quarter after it shut its consumer-to-consumer platform, which had been swamped with fake goods, though a growing customer base drove stronger-than-expected sales growth. Shares in the company rose 5% in early trading, paring the stock's year-to-date decline to 16%. JD.com, a smaller rival to Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., two years ago teamed up with China's gaming and social-media company Tencent Holdings Ltd. in an attempt to chip away at Alibaba's dominance. As part of the tie-up, Tencent took a 15% stake in JD.com and JD.com acquired certain businesses from Tencent, including PaiPai.com. Late last year, JD.com said it would shutter PaiPai ""to combat the marketing and sale of counterfeit products."" Alibaba has similarly struggled with widespread counterfeiting, a problem it has said all e-commerce companies face. With the decision to close the PaiPai platform, JD.com booked an impairment charge of 2.75 billion yuan ($420 million) in the fourth quarter. Higher revenue helped to partially offset that effect. In all, the company reported a loss of 7.63 billon yuan, or 5.57 yuan a share, wider than its year-earlier loss of 454.3 million yuan, or 0.33 yuan a share. Excluding the PaiPai writedown and charges stemming from acquisitions, among other items, the company lost 661.7 million yuan after earning 83.8 million yuan a year earlier. Per American depositary share, adjusted for one-time items, JD.com reported a loss of 0.48 yuan, compared with a profit of 0.06 yuan a year earlier. Analysts had projected an adjusted loss of 0.15 cents. Revenue increased to 54.61 billion yuan from 34.72 billion yuan, and above analysts' projections of 51.93 billion yuan. JD.com grabbed more customers last year and a bigger customer pushed sales 57% higher in the fourth quarter. The company ended the year with 155 million annual active customer accounts in its core business, up 71% from a year earlier and up 22% sequentially. Chief Executive Richard Liu pointed to rising demand from China's middle class and performance in the company's core JD Mall business. For the current quarter, the company said it expects revenue growth to slow to a 45% to 50% clip.

TCEHY	"Baidu Inc. said its fourth-quarter adjusted earnings and revenue beat expectations, sending its American depositary shares higher. In recent after-hours trading, Baidu's ADRs rose 11% to $176.90. For the current quarter, China's dominant search engine projected revenue of 15.41 billion yuan to 15.97 billion yuan ($2.38 billion to $2.47 billion). Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected revenue of 16.32 billion yuan. Baidu, sometimes called China's Google, has been investing heavily--with much of the spending for subsidies and discounts--to win share in the market it calls ""transaction services,"" which connect online customers to brick-and-mortar services such as food delivery. Baidu competes in this market with startups that are well-funded by venture capital or backed by Internet rivals Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. In the latest quarter, Baidu's operating costs grew 37%. Over all, Baidu reported a profit of 24.71 billion yuan ($3.815 billion), or 70.92 yuan ($10.95) an ADR, up from 3.24 billion yuan, or 9.03 yuan an ADR, a year earlier. Excluding a gain recognized in Baidu's exchange of Qunar Cayman Islands Ltd. shares with Ctrip.com International Ltd. and other items, adjusted earnings were 7.61 yuan ($1.18) an ADR. Analysts expected 6.62 yuan an ADR. Revenue increased 33% to 18.7 billion yuan. The company had expected revenue of 18.20 billion yuan to 18.75 billion yuan. Online-marketing sales rose 27% as the number of active online-marketing customers improved 6.1% to roughly 555,000 and revenue per customer increased 17%. Rivals Ctrip.com and Qunar, two of China's biggest online travel companies, in October unveiled plans to join forces in a share swap amid intensifying competition for booking train, plane and hotel reservations in the fast-growing market.

TCEHY	Western Union Co. said its fourth-quarter profit fell 4.2% and projected that currency rates will continue to hurt results in 2016. The company expects 2016 earnings of $1.58 to $1.70 a share, including a negative effect of about 15 cents from currency and reduced hedge benefits. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters project $1.72. Western Union expects revenue on a constant-currency basis will rise by the low- to mid-single digits, but projects currency and lower hedge benefits will cut revenue by about $250 million. The company also increased its quarterly dividend to 16 cents from 15.5 cents. Western Union has faced more competition as it expands from a cash-based business to one with a more digital focus. PayPal Holdings Inc.'s November purchase of Xoom created a large global competitor in money transfer. The company's recent digital moves include a partnership with China's Tencent Holdings Ltd. announced in November for mobile payments on the WeChat app. Last week, Western Union said it formed an alliance with mobile app provider Viber. Former Barclays PLC executive Elizabeth G. Chambers recently joined the company in the newly formed post of chief strategy and product officer. On Tuesday, the company said consumer-to-consumer revenue increased 21% at Westernunion.com and said it made progress in digital efforts like WU Connect. For the quarter ended Dec. 31, the company earned $212.3 million, or 42 cents a share, compared with $221.5 million, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier. Fewer shares were outstanding this year. Revenue fell 2% to $1.38 billion. On a constant-currency basis, revenue was up 3%. Cost-management efforts led to higher operating margins. For the full year, revenue fell 2% to $5.48 billion and earnings excluding items were $1.67 a share. The company had projected a low- to mid-single digit revenue decline and earnings excluding items of $1.60 to $1.67 a share. The company was in talks last year to buy Australia-based foreign exchange services provider OzForex Ltd., but negotiations ended without a deal. Shares were up 12 cents to $17.12 in after-hours trading.

TCEHY	"China and cloud computing have been the biggest reasons for optimism about sales growth for many technology suppliers. But Intel Corp. on Thursday raised worries about both, sending its share price tumbling and adding to fears rocking the stock market. The giant chip maker issued a financial projection for the first fiscal quarter that was lower than analysts expected, after subtracting the effect of an extra workweek in the period and the impact of a recent acquisition. Intel executives attributed its low expectation largely to the possibility of lower sales of personal computers in China, a huge market for many U.S. technology suppliers. ""Our team on the ground in China has gotten fairly cautious about what's going on,"" said Stacy Smith, Intel's chief financial officer, during a conference call with analysts to discuss its fourth-quarter results. At the same time, Intel reported that revenue in its data center group grew just 5% in the fourth quarter, compared with 12% in its third period. That slowing pace contrasted with the company's bullish comments about purchases, made by big cloud-computing providers, of servers that use its technology. The company's shares plunged 9% Friday following its comments. Other technology vendors that suffered included memory chip maker Micron Technology Inc., whose shares dropped 8%; rival chip maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc., also off 8%; cloud services specialist Rackspace Hosting Inc., down 7%; and computer maker HP Inc., off 5%. Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., sells the vast majority of the microprocessor chips that serve as calculating engines in PCs. That business has been hurt in recent years as consumer spending has shifted to products like smartphones. Intel said on Thursday that unit shipments of PC chips in the fourth quarter were 16% lower than the year-earlier period, though revenue for that business was off only 1% as customers bought more expensive chips. China, as the world's largest PC market, has an outsize effect. Intel didn't elaborate on conditions in that country, but people who track business conditions there say PC sales are weak. ""The PC is not a good story in China,"" said Handel Jones, an analyst at International Business Strategies Inc. One factor affecting Intel's fortunes in China is that many consumers there prefer tablets, which by and large don't contain Intel chips, while those that buy PCs tend to buy models that use relatively inexpensive Intel components, he said. In servers, Intel executives have recently said that slower sales to companies that buy such machines to run their own operations have been more than offset by sales to cloud companies. Diane Bryant, senior vice president and general manager of Intel's data center group, said at an analyst meeting in November that server purchases were growing at a 30% rate for the seven largest cloud companies: Google Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc. and Microsoft Corp. in the U.S., and China's Tencent Holdings Ltd., Baidu Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. She put purchase growth among the next 50 largest cloud companies at 40%. So the lackluster 5% growth rate for the data center unit in the fourth quarter surprised some analysts. Intel executives pointed to several causes. For one, Mr. Smith said, sales in the data center business rose around 25% in the year-earlier period, so that division faced an unusually high bar. Brian Krzanich, Intel's chief executive, added that many cloud companies don't want to disrupt operations by installing new computers during the fourth-quarter selling season. Surprising quarterly swings due to large sales transactions are common in the server-chip business, the Intel executives added, making it more sensible to focus on results over multiple quarters. Revenue for the data center group for all of 2015 rose 11% to about $16 billion. ""We're looking at the long view, and we're very confident that, yes, we'll continue this double-digit growth in the data center,"" Mr. Krzanich told analysts.

TCEHY	The Economist This type of gloomy magazine cover can indicate that investors are becoming too bearish about an asset class, region or market sector. As a contrarian thinker, you have to be on the lookout for signs that the unruly herd has turned too bearish on an asset class — signaling that it’s time to buy. An all-time favorite is the magazine-cover indicator. The idea here is that when the media put the bear case for a sector or region on the cover, the crowd has reached peak negativity and it’s time to take the other side of the trade. That can be a very effective contrarian indicator. No, this doesn’t mean that journalists and editors are dumb. It means they are good at what they do. The media thrive on traffic, so they have to be keenly aware of what’s on people’s minds and write about it to attract interest. Almost by definition, this means magazines can feature the bear case for an asset class, region or market sector right about when it hits bottom. Recently, we got a great magazine-cover indicator from The Economist (yes, they do it, too), which pointed a finger at emerging markets (EM) as the next victim of excessive debt. A recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey confirmed the sentiment extreme here, finding that fund managers haven’t been this pessimistic about emerging markets equities since 2001. Here’s another confirmation: The MSCI Emerging Markets Index trades at a price-to-book ratio of around 1.3 vs a 10-year average of 1.8, says Pablo Echavarria, associate portfolio manager at the Thornburg Developing World Fund THDIX, -0.98% “The asset class bottomed at one times book during the financial crisis. We are not quite there, but we are close,” he says. What’s the best way to navigate emerging markets investing? Very carefully, according to four EM fund managers I recently checked in with. “For the average investor, it is really time to be selective,” says Xian Liang, co-portfolio manager to the U.S. Global Investors China Region Fund USCOX, -2.85% “Pick your spots.” Read on to see what four EM managers say this means. Invest in the right regions EM bears cite three main problems: the China slowdown, excessive debt and weak commodity prices (which we’ll discuss, below). But for Gary Greenberg, portfolio manager at the Calvert Emerging Markets Equity Fund CVMAX, -1.59% another challenge is also at work. Greenberg is worth listening to because his fund has beaten its benchmark by around 5 percentage points a year, annualized, over the past three to five years, according to Morningstar. That’s a great record. Greenberg says a bigger issue is that the old emerging markets game plan of growing rapidly by exporting cheap goods produced by low-cost labor — and never mind the pollution — no longer works as well. Instead, EM countries have to upgrade their economies by encouraging production of more sophisticated goods and services and stronger domestic consumer spending. Countries that get this, or are on their way to making the transition, are the best places to be. Greenberg says Chile, Taiwan, Poland, the Czech Republic and Korea have already made the transition. Countries on their way include India, Indonesia, China and Mexico. “Both represent good environments for companies to operate in,” says Greenberg, and he favors the latter group. Countries behind in this transition, either because their economies are commodity-focused or because they are distracted by geopolitical tensions or domestic political issues, include Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil, Turkey, Russia and South Africa. Go with the Chinese consumer EM bears like to harp on the industrial-sector slowdown in China. But as I recently wrote, there are plenty of signals from U.S. companies in China that the Chinese consumer is doing OK. EM portfolio managers also see signs of consumer strength inside China. Calvert’s Greenberg cites continued wage growth, and robust spending trends at restaurants and big online retailers like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, -2.93% “The consumer in China is doing OK,” says Greenberg. China Switches to Hero From Villain in Climate Talks He likes Alibaba as a play on this trend because its growth is picking up and the company will continue to take market share. This is a top-10 holding in his fund. But his biggest China Internet play, and the top holding in his fund, is Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY, -2.58% which runs two giant social-networking platforms, Weixin and QQ. Tencent judiciously reinvests cash from its online gaming division to improve its social-media offerings, and it’s gradually monetizing its big user base. “We see Tencent as the best player in this space,” says Greenberg. Echavarria, at the Thornburg Developing World Fund, favors the online retailer JD.com Inc. JD, -2.39% which recently posted quarterly revenue growth north of 50%. “They appear to have the best logistics network among the Internet companies in China,” he says. “They have guaranteed one-day delivery in a number of Chinese cities.” Liang, at the U.S. Global Investors China Region Fund, likes footwear and sports-apparel companies as a play on rising health and fitness awareness in China. His fund owns a company called ANTA Sports Products, which is listed in Hong Kong, but a U.S.-listed company that offers exposure to this trend is Nike Inc. NKE, -2.93% Go with India’s infrastructure build-out In some ways, India is like China was 20 years ago. It has a lot of young people entering the workforce, and it’s in the midst of an investment boom to build out its infrastructure and manufacturing base. To do all of this, it has to upgrade everything from its ports and transportation system, to its electricity supply and payments system. Most of the companies that will benefit directly are listed only locally. But two Indian banks listed on U.S. exchanges offer a way to get exposure. One is HDFC Bank Ltd. HDB, -1.90% This bank is growing its loan book rapidly while keeping a lid on dud loans. It’s also a play on the megatrend of offering more banking services to India’s vast rural population. Its chief competitors are less-efficient government banks, so it has room to take market share. “This bank is not cheap, but it is a good growth story,” says Greenberg. This is a top-five holding in the Calvert Emerging Markets Equity Fund, which Greenberg manages. The other is ICICI IBN, -1.52% a commercial lender that should benefit from the build-out of the infrastructure and industrial base. What to avoid Greenberg is cautious on Chinese banks because they aren’t transparent about underperforming loans. He suspects many of these banks will have to raise capital over the next five years. Greenberg is also cautious on commodity-related stocks because of what he foresees as ongoing sluggishness in the Chinese economy over the next several years. A recent report by Barclays predicted that demand for copper and gold would suffer the most, among metals, from China sluggishness. But what about the bear case? And what about the bear case behind our Economist magazine-cover indicator? The story cites high emerging markets debt loads, weak commodity prices and a China slowdown as three of the main reasons to worry. But these may not be such big negatives, maintains Eric Moffett, portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price Asia Opportunities Fund TRAOX, -1.54% While it’s true that there’s been a big increase in debt levels in China, it’s important to keep in mind that consumer debt, which can wreak the most havoc on economies when it gets out of hand, is extremely low. “Here in Asia, particularly in China, there is very little consumer leverage,” Moffett said in a recent interview from Hong Kong. He notes that a quarter of all residential real estate is purchased with cash, and those who use mortgages have to put down 50%. “The consumer balance sheet is fine,” he says. Meanwhile, state-run companies in China have a lot of debt, but they have borrowed from state-owned banks. These banks, and the politicians behind them, don’t have an interest in playing hardball over loans. “That reduces the [probability of a] day of reckoning,” says Moffett. As for weak commodity prices, Moffett notes that most of Asia, which accounts for about 70% of emerging markets GDP, actually benefits from lower commodity prices. They are more buyers than sellers of commodities, except for Malaysia. Obviously, though, Russia and Brazil are being hurt by weak commodity prices. Finally, while it’s true China’s economy will most likely continue to slow, the risk of the dreaded hard landing is probably low. China has lots of dollar reserves it can use to shore up the banking system. And unlike the Fed, China’s central bank still has room to cut interest rates to help the economy. It also has room to lower reserve requirements at banks, which can encourage lending. “The Chinese government has a number of things it can do to control the speed of a slowdown,” says Moffett. “And some big, uncontrolled collapse is not in the interest of the government.” At the time of publication, Michael Brush had no positions in any stocks mentioned in this column.

TCEHY	"HONG KONG-- Tencent Holdings Ltd. reported a 32% rise in third-quarter net profit, with solid revenue growth in mobile games and advertising, highlighting the Chinese Internet giant's resilience as China's economy slows. The strong results helped ease concerns over intensifying competition in China's smartphone-games market. A sharp increase in advertising revenue during the quarter is also reassuring for investors who are counting on mobile ads to become a future growth engine for Tencent, which has generated more than half its revenue from games. Tencent, China's biggest social-network and online-games company, said Tuesday that its net profit for the three months through Sept. 30 rose to 7.45 billion yuan ($1.17 billion) from 5.66 billion yuan a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter rose 34% to 26.59 billion yuan. This was despite slowing economic growth. Earlier this month, President Xi Jinping warned that China's economy faces domestic and global uncertainties, and suggested that Beijing could tolerate a rate of growth as low as 6.5%. Analysts say fluctuations in the economy typically don't much affect demand for online games, and Tencent is less vulnerable than its peers. Tencent said revenue from smartphone games was 5.3 billion yuan, up 60% from a year earlier--a sharp acceleration from the second quarter's 11% pace. This year, Tencent has been stepping up its efforts to earn more revenue from advertising. Analysts expect mobile advertising to become a new revenue engine for the company in coming years. In the third quarter, Tencent's online advertising revenue nearly doubled from a year earlier to 4.94 billion yuan, Tencent said, with more than 65% from mobile ads. Tencent operates WeChat and QQ, two of China's most popular platforms for messaging and social networking. The company generates revenue by offering games and other services through the two platforms and by placing advertising on them. WeChat's population of active users grew to 649.5 million in September from 600 million in July, Tencent said, while active users of QQ's mobile app increased to 639.1 million from 627 million. To take advantage of the massive mobile traffic, Tencent's mobile platforms are hosting more performance-based ads, which help advertisers target specific types of consumers and charge per click. In January, for example, WeChat's ""moments"" section, a Facebook-like personal newsfeed page, started running sponsored posts from advertisers. In the third quarter, revenue from performance-based ads more than doubled, Tencent said. WeChat and QQ are also playing greater roles as mobile-payment tools. By linking their bank accounts with WeChat and QQ accounts, Chinese consumers can use the apps to pay for things from restaurant meals and movie tickets to taxi rides. As of September, more than 200 million WeChat and QQ user accounts were bundled with bank accounts, Tencent said. Over the past year, Tencent has also been making a big push into entertainment by striking deals with Hollywood studios and global music companies to distribute their movies and music through Tencent's online platforms in China. Last week, it announced movie-distribution deals in China with two Hollywood studios-- Viacom Inc.'s Paramount Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. While such deals may not translate into revenue for the short term, entertainment programs entice users to spend more time on Tencent platforms. In the long run, entertainment offerings could help generate additional revenue through subscription fees and advertising, analysts say.

TCEHY	"TOKYO--Investors dumped shares of Nintendo Co. after the company delayed the introduction of its first smartphone game and provided only a bare-bones outline of its much anticipated plan to join the mobile gaming boom. Nintendo on Thursday unveiled a mobile application called Miitomo that looks more like a social networking service than a shoot 'em up. Users can share personal information with friends via Mii avatars, which are currently used in Nintendo consoles. Instead of clearing up the mystery over which of its famous characters would make the leap to smartphones first, Nintendo raised new doubts about its mobile ambitions. After previously saying it would introduce its first smartphone game by the end of the year, the company said Thursday that Miitomo wouldn't be available until March 2016. Shares of Nintendo fell nearly 9%, while those of DeNA Co., the mobile gaming operator with which Nintendo has joined with for its foray into smartphones, plunged 15%. DeNA declined to comment on the move. ""The unveiling shows that Nintendo does not have this huge mobile-game launch plan many were hoping for,"" said Amir Anvarzadeh, head of Japan equities at BGC Partners. Nintendo Chief Executive Tatsumi Kimishima said at an investor briefing in Tokyo that the company delayed the introduction because it needed more time to explain and promote Miitomo. The company described Miitomo as a game, but the app appears to resemble a mobile messaging service more than hit smartphone games such as Clash of Clans, Candy Crush Saga or Angry Birds, which are fueling the growth of the industry. The Mii avatars prompt users with questions about their personal interests, then compile that information into profiles they share with friends. The company didn't say when it would introduce a full-fledged videogame, though it reiterated that its entire catalog of characters, including Mario the plumber, was available for mobile use. Analysts said the company probably didn't want to risk Mario on an unproven mobile format, but might introduce him subsequently. Nintendo said it was creating a new membership service, called My Nintendo, to connect users of its hardware as well as those using PCs and mobile devices. It said it would use a cloud-based service to transfer data between mobile games and console games. My Nintendo, which is set to be introduced in March, will also offer users points that can be spent on digital content and other rewards, Mr. Kimishima said. Users will be able to login with social media accounts, the company said. Executives said the company would broaden its push to expand the reach of its characters, or ""intellectual property,"" into new areas like theme parks and consumer products. ""We are going to be far more aggressive in using our I.P., and not just stop with licensing, as in the past,"" said Shigeru Miyamoto, the developer of some of Nintendo's most iconic games, who now holds the title of creative fellow. Nintendo and DeNA have said they would release five games by March 2017 under the partnership they announced in March. That deal marked an about-face by Nintendo's former chief, Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July. Mr. Iwata previously said the company had no interest in making games for smartphones, preferring to stick with its time-tested console-based business model. It isn't the first big shift for Nintendo, a 126-year-old company that used to make playing cards. While some analysts said the company's embrace of smartphone gaming could unleash new revenue streams, others say the company is coming to the table too late--even without the latest delay. Digi-Capital, a consulting firm, said mobile-gaming revenue world-wide will rise to $45 billion in 2018 from $29 billion this year. The smartphone-game market is crowded with countless titles jockeying for consumers' attention. Most of these games are free to download, with game providers trying to earn revenue through advertising and in-game purchases. The challenge facing Nintendo was underscored by its latest earnings report, on Wednesday, in which the company's profit for the six months through September fell short of analyst expectations, held back by sluggish sales of the Wii U console and 3DS hand-held devices. ""The delay and the first app are disappointing, but the platform and openness to use intellectual property such as Mario in the future might mean that Nintendo can roll out something big"" in the future, said Serkan Toto, a Tokyo-based game consultant.

Their alliance would reshape China’s fiercely competitive market for smartphone applications connecting users with brick-and-mortar services. Meituan, whose services are similar to Groupon Inc. of the U.S., Dianping, which is sometimes compared with Yelp of the U.S., and other competitors have been locked in a price war to attract consumers by subsidizing discounts, and some venture capitalists have said such a business model wouldn’t be sustainable in the long run.

Meituan and Dianping said that their decision to team up and create a new company was supported by Alibaba and Tencent, as well as other investors such as venture-capital firm Sequoia Capital China, which has invested in both Meituan and Dianping. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Meituan and Dianping were nearing a combination that could create a business valued at more than $15 billion, citing people familiar with the situation. One of the people said that the new company created by Meituan and Dianping is expected to raise fresh capital at a new valuation.

TCEHY	China’s homegrown ride-hailing service has opened a new front in its battle with global industry leader Uber Technologies Inc. by backing Uber’s biggest U.S. rival, Lyft Inc. In a funding round that closed in May, Didi Kuaidi Joint Co. invested in Lyft alongside China’s top Internet companies, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, -2.93%  and Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY, -2.58%  , according to people familiar with the situation. Didi and Tencent were new investors in Lyft’s latest round and Alibaba put in more cash after an initial investment last year, they said. The size of investments couldn’t be learned. By investing in Uber’s top U.S. competitor, Didi Kuaidi and the Chinese Internet giants seek to boost the competitive threat to Uber in its home market as the ride-hailing app is expanding in China. Calling China its most important global market, Uber has set an ambitious goal to expand to 100 more Chinese cities in the next year. Didi Kuaidi dominates the taxi-hailing market in China and claims more than 80% of the private-car-hailing market there. The Chinese companies invested as part of Lyft’s last funding round in May, which valued the company at $2.5 billion, according to a person familiar with the deal. Activist billionaire Carl Icahn’s participation in that round was previously disclosed, but the participation of Didi, Tencent and Alibaba wasn’t. Lyft has discussed ways to work with its Chinese investors to compete strategically with Uber, including sharing product plans, the person familiar with the matter said.

TCEHY	Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. plan to invest in China Media Capital’s Internet-TV startup, according to people with knowledge of the matter, in a rare collaboration between the two Chinese Internet giants. Li Ruigang, chairman of state-backed private-equity fund CMC, said it founded a startup called Whaley Technology earlier this year to make smart televisions, with the first product set to be unveiled Thursday. Alibaba BABA, -2.93%  and Tencent 0700, +1.58% TCEHY, -2.58% both of which reported their latest quarterly earnings Wednesday, plan to put capital, technology and content into Whaley, people close to the situation said. Through their planned investment, Alibaba and Tencent--fierce rivals with few alliances--would be betting that smart TVs will be the next gadget of choice for the country’s consumers. Earlier this year, Chinese cellphone maker Xiaomi Corp . unveiled a 55-inch TV that it sells for around 4,999 yuan ($805). Whaley TV sets, also 55 inches, will be sold starting two weeks from now on Alibaba’s Tmall website in addition to Whaley’s own website, using Alipay as the online payment channel. They will later be available on other e-commerce platforms, said Mr. Li, a former head of state broadcaster Shanghai Media Group, who declined to disclose a retail price.

TCEHY	"HONG KONG--Chinese Internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd.'s latest quarterly results revealed a slowdown in its core online-games business, highlighting the need for the company to turn online advertising into a bigger engine for growth. Tencent has built a lucrative business by offering online games to users of its popular messaging and social-networking services. But the market for games played on personal computers is becoming increasingly saturated, while competition is intensifying in smartphone games. Numbers released Wednesday showed the rate of growth in online games slowing to 17% in the second quarter from 28% in the first quarter. Growth in smartphone-games revenue also slowed to 11% in the second quarter from 82% in the first quarter. Still, Tencent's net-profit growth in the second quarter beat analysts' expectations, helped in part by lower marketing expenses. Net profit for the three months ended June 30 rose 25% to 7.31 billion yuan ($1.15 billion) from 5.84 billion yuan a year earlier, while revenue rose 19% to 23.43 billion yuan. The slowdown in games revenue highlights the importance of online advertising as a key driver of Tencent's future growth. In the second quarter, Tencent's online advertising revenue jumped 97% to 4.07 billion yuan. Online video-advertising revenue in the quarter more than doubled from a year earlier, with more than half of the revenue coming from mobile videos, Tencent said. Online advertising accounted for 17% of Tencent's overall revenue in the second quarter, compared with 10% a year earlier. ""Games will continue to be the core business for Tencent, but investors are looking for the next growth engine. And advertising is a key area,"" said Daiwa Securities analyst John Choi. Online-games revenue in the second quarter was ""a bit disappointing,"" he added. Analysts say there is plenty of room for Tencent's WeChat mobile-messaging app, known for its clean user interface, to become a lucrative mobile-advertising platform. In January, WeChat's ""moments"" section, a Facebook-like newsfeed page where users share photos and other status updates, started running sponsored posts from advertisers. While mobile advertising is the engine for Tencent's growth over the next few years, mobile payments is another area where Tencent is placing its bets. Tencent operates its own online-payment system called Tenpay. In the first quarter, it accounted for 11% of China's mobile-payment market by transactions, while rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.'s Alipay payment affiliate dominated the market with a 79% share, according to iResearch. Since last year, Tencent has been pouring resources into getting more people to use Tenpay. The company is expected to increase its presence in the mobile-payments market thanks to the popularity of various e-commerce services that are integrated in its messaging apps, analysts say. To process more mobile transactions, Tencent has invested in a number of mobile apps and other services that connect online users with bricks-and-mortar services. Many of those services have been linked to the company's messaging platforms, making it easier for users to access apps and pay for everything from taxi rides to movie tickets and food delivery services through Tencent's mobile-payment system. Earlier this month, Tencent offered to buy the rest of Chinese online travel firm eLong Inc. it didn't already own for $622 million, as part of its strategy to link online users with offline services. In January, Tencent participated in a $350 million investment round for Chinese food delivery app startup Ele.me. As of June, Tencent's smartphone messaging apps, Mobile QQ and WeChat, had 627 million and 600 million active users, respectively, according to the company. In March, Mobile QQ had 603 million users while WeChat had 549 million users.

TCEHY	BEIJING — China’s rapidly diversifying Internet giants are now taking on Western food chains at their own game — door-to-door delivery — and finding a huge appetite among urban consumers. Wooing customers with discounted dishes and the choice of thousands of restaurants, startups backed by the likes of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. are enjoying brisk business as more diners opt to order in. ‘The delivery market is getting competitive.’ McDonald’s spokeswoman The growing fleet of motorbike couriers on Chinese roads is the latest challenge to long-established but struggling Western companies such as McDonald’s Corp. MCD, -1.65%  and Yum Brands Inc. YUM, -1.80% which owns KFC and Pizza Hut outlets. For years, the fast-food chains got a leg up over rivals by speeding hamburgers and fried chicken to buyers’ homes and offices, building their own armies of bike-riding couriers who dash out orders that were phoned in or place online. The Western chains became popular in China for two main reasons: “Because they were foreign and they delivered,” said Nathan Snyder, a research analyst at brokerage CLSA. “That’s no longer an advantage,” he said, referring to the delivery. Startup companies Ele.me and Meituan Waimai, which operate via mobile applications and are backed respectively by Tencent TCEHY, -2.58% and Alibaba BABA, -2.93% are getting economy of scale by teaming up with tens of thousands of food outlets across China.

TCEHY	"Chinese online travel company eLong Inc. LONG, +1.33% has received a takeover offer from its shareholder Tencent Holdings Ltd. (TCEHY, 0700.HK), the latest move in a sector that has seen an abundance of deal activity. Tencent is offering $18 per American depositary share in a preliminary, nonbinding proposal dated Monday. That provides a 24% premium to Friday's closing price and a 27% premium to Monday's price. In after-hours trading Monday, ADSs rose 10% to $15.65. ELong's board will form a special committee to consider the offer. Tencent's operations include the messaging app WeChat and the social network Qzone. ELong also said it swung to a second-quarter loss as revenue declined. Hotel revenue was lower in part due to an ""aggressive"" coupon program, and transportation revenue fell as major Chinese airlines lowered their base air commission rates. In May, Expedia Inc. sold its majority stake in eLong for $671 million to a group of buyers including Ctrip.com International Ltd., Keystone Lodging Holdings Ltd., Plateno Group Ltd. and Luxuriant Holdings Ltd. Expedia's involvement with eLong dated back to 2005, when Expedia's then-parent IAC/InterActiveCorp. took a controlling interest in the Chinese company. In late May, Priceline Group Inc. invested an additional $250 million in Ctrip, after a $500 million bet made last year. Ctrip made an unsolicited bid for Qunar Cayman Islands Ltd., which rejected the offer and announced a $500 million investment led by private-equity firm Silver Lake in early June. China's booming online travel business has become increasingly competitive as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and other Internet companies look to tap the surging ranks of Chinese tourists. In October, Alibaba unveiled a travel marketplace branded Alitrip, a revamp of its Taobao Travel arm.

TCEHY	Former employees of Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s online video business, one of whom is currently a senior executive at Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., have been detained by authorities in a bribery investigation, in a potential blow to the two Chinese Internet giants’ efforts to expand their online entertainment services. Shenzhen-based Tencent TCEHY, -2.58% a major social networks and online games company, said Friday that six former employees of its online video business have been arrested, including one surnamed Zhang and another surnamed Yue. Alibaba BABA, -2.93%  , Tencent’s chief rival in China, said Patrick Liu, president of the e-commerce company’s digital entertainment business group who previously managed Tencent’s online video business, has been detained by authorities. “This issue is related to his time at Tencent and has nothing to do with Alibaba,” an Alibaba spokesman said. Liu left Tencent and joined Alibaba in 2013. The investigation comes as both Tencent and Alibaba, two of China’s largest Internet companies, have recently been beefing up their online entertainment offerings such as movies and music through alliances and acquisitions. Online entertainment has become a key battleground for Tencent and Alibaba as they try to lure users away from each other and seek new sources of revenue. Last year, for example, Tencent signed a deal with Time Warner Inc.’s TWX, -0.90%   HBO network to distribute its television dramas and movies through the Chinese firm’s online video site. Alibaba this year signed a deal with BMG, the music division of Germany’s Bertelsmann SE, to promote BMG’s artists through its online entertainment services headed by Mr. Liu. “We are shocked by this,” Alibaba said in a post on its official Weibo microblog account, adding that the company has made arrangements for Liu’s work to be covered by others. In the same Weibo post Alibaba also said: “Young people are not entitled to break the law; young people will always make mistakes; young people should bear the consequences that they have to shoulder; young people should have lives in the future.” An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.

TCEHY	BEIJING (Caixin Online) — A state-owned media company recently said it is setting up a firm to explore businesses in the sports industry, such as holding events.  ABOUT CAIXIN Caixin is a Beijing-based media group dedicated to providing high-quality and authoritative financial and business news and information through periodicals, online and TV/video programs. • Get the Caixin e-newsletter The new firm will have registered capital of 500 million yuan ($80.5 million), Beijing Hualu Baina Film & TV Co. said in a statement on June 10. The company and one of its subsidiaries will partner in the investment. Hualu Baina said the firm is part of the company’s strategy to take advantage of opportunities in the sports industry created by government policies. This makes it one of many firms trying to score in sports amid a push by the central government to have the industry contribute more to the economy. Big-time sports in China are young compared to those in Western countries, a report by GF Securities Co. Ltd. said. The industry contributed only 0.6% to China’s GDP in 2012, while the figure in the U.S. was 2.59%. President Xi Jinping and other leaders have mentioned many times since late 2013 that they would like to see the industry develop, said Lei Zhenjian, CEO of the sports arm of Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corp. 300104, +1.56% a Shenzhen-listed Internet TV company better known as LeTV. In October last year, the State Council announced plans to have the sports industry contribute 5 trillion yuan to GDP by 2025. The cabinet also said it will eliminate barriers that hinder the industry’s rapid development and encourage private capital to invest in building facilities and providing related products and services. This year, the General Administration of Sport, a government regulatory body, has also announced a series of measures aimed at relaxing rules for holding sporting events. Also, on March 16, the cabinet announced a plan to turn soccer into the national sport. A key aspect of that plan is introducing competition to the handing out of broadcast rights. Two months later, a media company in Beijing called China Sports Media Ltd. beat 13 competitors, including state broadcaster China Central Television, to sign a four-year deal with the Chinese Football Association for the rights to raw video feed for games involving the national soccer teams. Government policies have also encouraged investors and companies to start new firms, like Hualu Baina’s new sports venture, and expand their related products and services. Nine investors including developer Dalian Wanda Group and Yunfeng Capital, which was co-founded by Jack Ma, provided 800 million yuan to LeTV’s sports firm on May 13. Lei said LeTV set up the company at the end of 2013 when it saw the government would lend its support to the industry. “We think it will see explosive growth soon,” he said. The firm plans to run events and provide media content and other value-added services. Some 50 investors showed interest in the sports firm in August last year when the company made it known it was looking for capital, Lei said. Fundraising had to be suspended because one investor got caught up in a corruption investigation into an official in the northern province of Shanxi. When the firm restarted financing efforts in February, Wanda — fresh off its purchase of the Swiss marketing company Infront Sports & Media for 1.05 billion euros ($1.18 billion) on Feb. 10 — jumped aboard. Lei said a Wanda representative talked with him for only about 20 minutes before deciding to invest 200 million yuan in his firm. More investors followed suit, such as Yunfeng Capital and Prometheus Capital. Key to success The government’s helping hand has encouraged investors to put their money into the industry, said Wang Ran, the founder and CEO of China eCapital Corp., an investment company. However, he said that for now only a few projects are good enough to gain an investment. In January, Internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. 0700, +1.53% TCEHY, -2.58%  signed a five-year, $100 million deal to be the official digital partner of the National Basketball Association (NBA) in China. Tencent will show live games from the U.S. league on the Internet and deliver related programing and highlights. An NBA employee said the deal was worth about five times more than a previous agreement Tencent and Sina Corp. SINA, -2.65%  had to put NBA games online. Xie Yuefeng, deputy editor-in-chief of the Tencent website qq.com, said the cost of getting copyright for sporting events like NBA games has increased a lot over the past two years. Dong Li, a media director of PPTV, a company that provides viewers online videos and other content, said large investors and Internet firms encouraged by government policies are pouring money into sports but are ignoring costs. He warned that these companies may not make enough money to cover their costs if they just sell ads for live games. Sina failed to win the contract with the NBA so it has turned to other sports, such as golf, tennis, auto racing, chess and equestrian events, a source with knowledge of the matter said. Each sport is unique, said Yu Hang, the vice president of the copyright department of LeTV, and even marathon events are interesting to viewers. The key to success is providing different and exclusive services, he said. For example, the TV broadcasts of Formula One auto-racing events provide viewers with just one video feed, but LeTV could provide multiple TV angles of the race and let viewers pick the one they want.

TCEHY	A decision by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to sell its U.S. online shopping site to a U.S. rival highlights the challenges facing the Chinese electronic-commerce company in mature Western markets dominated by competitors such as Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -3.20%   and eBay Inc. EBAY, -2.35%   On Tuesday, Alibaba BABA, -2.93%  said it is selling 11 Main, an online marketplace that started only a year ago, to OpenSky, an online-marketplace operator based in New York. In exchange, Alibaba is taking a 37.6% stake in OpenSky. In another deal announced Tuesday, Alibaba and its financial-services affiliate, Ant Financial Services Group, are together investing nearly $1 billion in an Alibaba food-delivery booking service in China called Koubei, hoping to turn it into a local services platform to challenge similar apps backed by rival Tencent Holdings Ltd. 0700, +1.58% TCEHY, -2.58%   The two deals highlight Alibaba’s priorities as earnings slow down and competition intensifies at home. Alibaba, which went public in the U.S. in September in a $25 billion initial public offering of stock, might pursue electronic-commerce opportunities in the U.S. in the long run, but for the time being, analysts and investors are paying more attention to Alibaba’s efforts to solidify its strong position in the Chinese market. Alibaba holds roughly 80% of China’s online shopping market. When California-based 11 Main first made its marketplace available on an invitation-only basis in June 2014, the company said it had a “robust marketing plan” to support growth for shops featured on the site. Some U.S. merchants who opened their stores on 11 Main said they were counting on Alibaba’s deep pockets to make the marketplace successful. But 11 Main struggled to gain attention and support from Alibaba headquarters in China, according to a person familiar with the matter. An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.

TCEHY	If Netflix Inc. still plans to enter China, it may have a tougher time than anticipated. Alibaba Group Holding’s BABA, -2.93% plan to launch a Netflix-style video-streaming service in two months could even kill Netflix’s NFLX, -1.74% plans, according to a note from Zacks Equity Research. Netflix  shares fell on the news Monday, as investors fretted that the company may be too late in figuring out a strategy for China. Chief Executive Reed Hastings has told investors in the past that while the company knows the best approach for most countries it looks to enter, for China, the company has been exploring options. Read: This is what Netflix needs to know about the Chinese TV viewer TimeNetflix Inc.22 Jan5 Feb19 Feb5 Mar19 Mar2 Apr US:NFLX $250 $300 Alibaba already has a strong position in multiple industries in the country, and a far closer knowledge of the consumers that it’s targeting. Add to that the fact that there are already a few other local companies with streaming services in China—Baidu Inc. BIDU, -2.55% Tencent Holdings TCEHY, -2.58%  and Sohu.com among others—and Netflix’s entrance starts to look more and more difficult. “This isn’t like some French company launching a service in China,” said Needham & Company analyst Laura Martin. “Alibaba [is a Chinese company]. This may put more pressure on Netflix’s pricing, or they might even decide not to enter China.” Netflix declined to comment on what Alibaba’s plans mean for the company. Martin, who on Tuesday raised her price target on Netflix to $780, or about 17% above its current trading level, said she had not included China in her estimates for the streaming giant going forward because it is such a difficult market to enter. Alibaba’s decision to delve into streaming, however, shouldn’t negatively impact Netflix’s expansion into Europe. FactSet Netflix, which added 2.6 million subscribers internationally last quarter, currently operates in the U.K., Ireland, the Netherlands and Nordic countries. Outside of Europe, Netflix has users in Canada, Latin America, and recently launched in Cuba, Australia and New Zealand. Also see: Analysts giddy at Netflix plans for international expansion Last year, Netflix reported $1.3 billion dollars in revenue internationally, which was up from $712 million in 2013, according to FactSet data. That number is only expected to continue to grow. International streaming revenue is expected to reach $1.9 billion in fiscal year 2015 and $3 billion in 2016, according to estimates from analysts surveyed by FactSet. “Offshore, we believe that NFLX’s international subscribers have 2-3 times faster profit trajectories than in the US, suggesting higher return on invested capital (ROIC), and therefore higher lifetime value per subscriber than US subscribers,” Martin wrote. “Buying content globally should create higher barriers to entry, or lower costs vis-a-vis competitors.” Needham is expecting Netflix to add advertising to its product some day to create another revenue stream. Netflix shares have climbed 95% in the year so far, far outperforming the S&P 500, which is up just 1.8%.

TCEHY	HONG KONG (Project Syndicate) — Five years ago, few would have expected that China would produce four of the top 10 global Internet companies (by number of visitors) — Alibaba BABA, -2.93% Baidu BIDU, -2.55% Tencent TCEHY, -2.58% and Sohu SOHU, -3.07%  — as well as innovative multinationals like Huawei and Xiaomi. Nor would most have anticipated China’s increasing provision of global public goods, including its “one belt, one road” strategy, which aims to provide the infrastructure needed to knit Eurasia into a single vast market. More remarkable news has just emerged: despite slowing economic-growth rates, China, together with Hong Kong, has recorded $29 billion in initial public offerings so far this year, almost twice the funds raised in U.S. markets. By any measure, the pace and scope of innovation in China has begun to increase. How has this happened, and why is it happening now? The answer lies in the unprecedented challenges that China faces, including corruption, pollution, unsustainable local debts, ghost towns, shadow banks, inefficient state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and excessive government control over the economy. Certainly, no one would argue that these are positive developments for China; nonetheless, they have arguably been a blessing in disguise. They have imbued reform efforts with a degree of urgency that has had a far-reaching impact; indeed, conventional GDP data do not reflect the scale of the transformation that they are driving. Of course, China has long been committed to market-driven structural reforms, at the national and municipal levels. It could not have attained its position as the world’s second-largest economy otherwise. But the key to China’s success has been constant experimentation, and the pursuit of that credo appears to have intensified. For example, the networking of telecommunications, roads, rail, air, and maritime transport enabled China to become a global hub for the production of consumer durables, and improve their distribution. More recently, China began to apply the same approach to building a more innovative, knowledge-based economy, one in which the services sectors, together with domestic consumption, drive growth. As a result, the country has increasingly been focusing on the so-called “killer apps” that, according to the historian Niall Ferguson, drove the West’s rise to economic dominance: competition, science, property, modern medicine, consumerism, and an ethic of hard work. In particular, China has worked to boost market competition and foster science and innovation, with progress in these areas underpinned by efforts to improve governance, strengthen mechanisms of accountability and boost investment in public goods. Crucially, even as China’s specific goals have shifted, its policymakers have adhered to the experimental approach that has served the country so well thus far. Indeed, it was the combination of broad-based education, openness to science and innovation, investment in advanced telecommunications infrastructure and knowhow in manufacturing smart-phones that fueled China’s rapid advancement in the e-tail and Internet industries. This openness to innovation – along with what some say is lax regulation — also allowed platforms like Alibaba to integrate payments and logistics before many Western players did. China’s “learning by doing” approach is likely to continue to yield innovative solutions to emerging problems. For example, faced with a shrinking labor force, the government has ramped up investment in robotic automation and other productivity-enhancing technologies. The impact on China’s competitiveness of rising real wages — which have been increasing by more than 15% annually since 2008 — will, the country’s leaders expect, ultimately be offset by the benefits of productivity-led growth, not to mention the much-needed increase in domestic consumption. Of course, China’s approach has brought significant stresses, setbacks, and failures. China’s real-estate, credit, and stock-market bubbles — which produced ghost towns, bad local debts, and stock-price volatility — attest to that. But the policy decisions that gave rise to these problems — decentralizing control over land and permitting markets to direct the flow of talents, trade, investment, and capital — have also been critical to progress. China’s leaders understand this well. Rather than avoiding risk, they remain prepared to reverse failing policies; and, if necessary, they are willing to pay for mistakes. Given the savings the country has built up, reflected in bulging foreign-exchange reserves, the central government has the fiscal room to afford it. Today’s anti-corruption campaign should be viewed as an effort by China’s leaders to correct another negative consequence of past policies. The approach is two-pronged: the government is privatizing some SOEs, so that market competition can check the behavior of corporate managers, while treating the managers of other (typically larger) SOEs as public servants, subject to the increasingly severe rules of public accountability, including party discipline. Earlier this month, President Xi Jinping announced a new wave of measures. China’s government is running real risks as it pushes through structural reforms that are unprecedented in speed, scale, and complexity. Fortunately, China has both the experience and the wherewithal to experiment with the next stage of structural transformation.

TCEHY	Shutterstock/Dmitry Kalinovsky BEIJING (Caixin Online) — A new fund that focuses on developing China’s next generation of industry — so-called Industry 4.0 — through investment in German small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will soon have its initial $1 billion raised, its founder says.  ABOUT CAIXIN Caixin is a Beijing-based media group dedicated to providing high-quality and authoritative financial and business news and information through periodicals, online and TV/video programs. • Get the Caixin e-newsletter Henry Cai, 61, a native of Shanghai, resigned as a senior executive at Deutsche Bank in February to set up the fund, which will invest in intelligent manufacturing, high-end equipment, advanced materials and medical technologies. The term “Industry 4.0” was first used in 2011 at the Hanover Fair. It refers to a fourth industrial revolution, following on from steam, electricity and information technology, and is based on cyber-physical systems connecting machines to minimize problems and costs. Production powerhouses have already moved to develop Industry 4.0, namely Germany with its manufacturing industry and the U.S. with its Internet technologies. On May 19, the central government unveiled its Made in China 2025 plan — a strategy intended to lead China to cutting-edge innovation and high-quality industrial products. Cai said that he set up the fund after China and Germany signed cooperation guidelines covering many sectors of Industry 4.0 in October, when Premier Li Keqiang visited the European country. The fund has gained the fundraising support of China’s sovereign-wealth funds and some Middle Eastern countries. Cai said the fund will play a key role in promoting the country’s 10-year plan to upgrade its manufacturing capacity by facilitating cooperation between Chinese and German companies. However, he warned that China will face many challenges in the course of reaching the advanced levels of the global production chain. From 2.0 to 4.0 China starts its Industry 4.0 revamp from a complicated background, Cai said. Most parts of the country and most of its companies have not finished the transformation from the electricity phase to automated production, he said. Meanwhile, Germany has basically finished the third phase of industrial revolution, and is well on its way to 4.0. Miao Wei, the minister of industry and information technology, has said the latest Internet technologies will help China go straight from the electricity phase to intelligent manufacturing. China can make 525 types of products and is the world largest producer of 223 types, Miao said, but he pointed out that these goods are on the low end of the global industrial chain. China could leap to Industry 4.0 with its advanced Internet network, Cai said. The country has already built technology companies such as Xiaomi Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co. 002502, +0.56%  and Internet firms like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, -2.93%  , Tencent Holdings Ltd. 0700, +1.58% TCEHY, -2.58%  and Baidu Inc. BIDU, -2.55%   Some Net companies get attention from venture capital and private-equity companies and go public overseas, Cai said, but manufacturing companies hardly win any investment. Chinese entrepreneurs have paid little attention to upgrading manufacturing to a high level and only want to make money quickly through buying shares or investing in websites and smartphone applications, he said. “Many people want to make fortunes by building a website or developing a mobile application, which is only a dream,” Cai said. “In Germany, it is different. A lot of people participate in researching and developing products.” China also lacks engineers, technicians and skillful workers, Cai said. Its companies have imported entire production lines, a move that has lowered demand for skilled laborers from rural areas. “China has enough lawyers, accountants and bankers in developing Industry 4.0, but it lacks of thousands of good engineers, technicians and skilled workers,” he said. Cooperation difficulties Having Chinese companies cooperate with German SMEs and major research centers for manufacturing is the best way to upgrade production levels, Cai said. However, cultural differences form a major barrier to cooperation, he said, which is why he set up an international team at the fund tasked with bridging these obstacles. Leaders of German companies say Chinese businessmen make unprofessional decisions in production and resort to random activities in operations, according to a report from accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. Chinese businessmen were seen as having little experience in controlling the entire process of international projects and had no feedback system or backup measures in places. Cooperation was hindered by not only language, culture and social development, but also in work styles. Cai built his fund team with members who used to work for international companies, such as Carlyle Group CG, -3.11% to help Chinese and German companies get to know each other better and avoid cultural and management problems. The fund also has as consultants German government officials and Chinese businessmen, such as Wang Chuanfu, chairman of Shenzhen-based BYD Auto Co. 1211, +3.56% BYDDF, -0.64% 002594, +2.65%   Another problem is that few German companies want to transfer technologies and patents to their Chinese peers because intellectual property is poorly protected in China, Cai said. In China, people who copy technologies and products are not heavily punished, Cai said, and in this environment no one is devoted to developing technologies and products. The country has made advancements in its legal system and protection of intellectual property, Cai said, but more needs to be done. Rewritten by Guo Kai See this report at Caixin Online.

TCEHY	HONG KONG (MarketWatch) — After enjoying some initial success in China, Uber is now finding itself caught in the middle of regulatory storm and a sometimes violent war between taxicab drivers and companies making not just ride-sharing apps, but even apps that help users hail traditional taxis. Last week in the central Chinese city of Luoyang, a group of angry taxi drivers laid siege to the local offices of Didi Kuaidi, the company born of the recent merger of China’s two largest taxi-hailing apps, the Beijing News reported, quoting Luoyang regulators. The police were forced to intervene, and a separate report from Caijing Magazine quoted sources from Didi Kuaidi as saying the city had shut down their Luoyang office. Assuming the Caijing account is correct, it wouldn’t be the first time the city had come down in favor of the taxi drivers and the government-owned companies they drive for — back in March, Luoyang suspended the use of taxi-hailing apps there, with the Beijing News citing a local official as saying such services “disturb the normal market order.” The cab drivers’ complaint is that the use of such apps circumvents their dispatchers, allowing those drivers who secretly work with the app to steal fares from those drivers who don’t. The Luoyang drivers have called for all local cabbies to boycott Didi Kuaidi and similar services. The drivers cite their struggle with the high monthly license fees they must pay to the taxi companies, are they have reportedly been venting their anger through labor strikes, blocking road traffic, and even assaulting other taxi drivers or vandalizing their cars if they refuse to join the protests or if they work with the controversial apps. But Didi Kuaidi isn’t powerless in this struggle, given that China’s two biggest Internet companies — Alibaba Group BABA, -2.93%  and Tencent Holdings Ltd. 0700, +1.58% TCEHY, -2.58% — are the major investors in the unlisted app company. Ride-sharing apps like Uber, however, may face a trickier situation.   Under increasing pressure, the Chinese government signaled earlier this year it won’t allow private cars to serve as taxis. And this month, the major cities of Guangzhou in the south and Chengdu in the west both reportedly staged raids on their local Uber offices. In fact, the Guangzhou went one step further, closing the Uber office and then announcing the upcoming launch of the city government’s own taxi-booking app, Ru Yue (“Rendezvous”), to be run in conjunction with several state-controlled taxi companies, according to a report by the official Southern Daily newspaper. That said, an editorial Thursday in Beijing Business Today appeared to come down in support of the apps, saying both taxi apps such as Didi Kuaidi and ride-sharing services such as Uber were “upsetting” those with vested interests in China’s monopolistic taxi markets. While the drivers’ “violent lobbying” was due to the feeling that these apps were eating their lunch, the government reaction was an instinctive move as officials tend to value social order above other considerations, including nurturing new technology, the editorial said. Uber could play ‘Catfish’ In commentary published Thursday in the Beijing News newspaper, China Mobile Internet Industry Association chief secretary Li Yi said Uber’s future in the country will remain uncertain until the government draws up specific regulations governing the industry. But Li said Uber has been doing well so far, even when compared to larger foreign companies that entered the Chinese market earlier, such as eBay Inc. EBAY, -2.35% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -3.20%    One factor working in Uber’s favor, Li said, was its cooperation with government inquiries and investigations, with Uber acting more like a Chinese company by showing an active willingness to communicate with officials. Li said China might do well to let Uber operate in the local market, as the company could act as a “catfish,” offering strong competition that could ultimately force Chinese rivals to up their game. The term “catfish” refers to the finding that some species of fish benefit from the presence of a predator, such as the catfish. Citic Securities analysts were upbeat on Uber’s outlook in China, writing in a recent note that such companies reflect genuine consumer demand in the country, given the prevalence of traffic congestion, idle private cars and difficulties in finding a taxi during rush hour. Despite the regulatory pressures, Uber will likely “exist side by side” with traditional taxi services for some time to come, Citic said. “Internet car service is the future of the car-service industry,” it said.

TCEHY	"Chinese Internet firm Sina Corp. posted higher revenue along with a wider operating loss, reflecting higher personnel and marketing expenses. The company said Thursday that its popular Weibo social media platform, which resembles Twitter, made progress in revenue and user growth. ""Weibo's mobile strategy has continued to deliver impressive results in both user traffic and revenue growth,"" the company said. Weibo's monthly active users were 198 million in March, up 38% from a year earlier. Sina was an early pioneer of the Chinese Internet, providing web portals, news aggregation and fee-based information services. The company has been battling with giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., and has diversified into such areas as online financial services. Sina's portal revenue declined. The company said it is ""experiencing a critical transformative period to revamp our legacy business and diversify our business models."" For the quarter ended March 31, Sina reported a net loss of $10.3 million, or 18 cents a share, compared with a loss of $33.2 million, or 52 cents a share, a year earlier. The year-earlier quarter included a $40.2 million loss from a change in fair value of investor option liability. Earnings excluding stock-based compensation and other items fell to four cents a share from 15 cents a share. Revenue rose 8% to $184.6 million. Weibo Corp. became a separate public company in April 2014. In its own earnings statement, the company said revenue increased 43% to $96.3 million, above its guidance of $93 million to $96 million. The company expects second-quarter revenue of $102 million and $105 million, which could change depending on the timing of planned initiatives with Alibaba.

TCEHY	"HONG KONG--Chinese Internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. is taking a page out of Facebook Inc.'s playbook, looking to spur long-term earnings growth from mobile advertising as the pace of its profit increase slows. On Wednesday, Tencent said its net profit for the three months ended March 31 rose 6.6% from a year earlier, a significant slowdown from the fourth quarter when net profit jumped 50%. The latest results, however, showed that the company, which derives the bulk of its revenue currently from online and mobile games, is making progress in generating more revenue from advertising. In the first quarter, Tencent's online advertising revenue more than doubled to 2.72 billion yuan ($438 million) from 1.17 billion a year earlier, driven mainly by mobile ads. Advertising now accounts for 12% of Tencent's revenue, compared with 6% a year earlier. While mobile games offered through smartphone messaging apps are expected to remain an engine for Tencent's growth this year, the company has been trying to turn its popular WeChat messaging app into an advertising platform similar to Facebook. In January, WeChat's ""moments"" section, a Facebook-like news feed page where users share photos and other status updates, started running sponsored posts from advertisers. Tencent is tapping into the huge growth potential for mobile advertising in China. As of December, the country had 557 million mobile Internet users, according to the government-affiliated China Internet Network Information Center. Total revenue in China's burgeoning mobile ads market, which stood at 29.7 billion yuan last year, is expected to double to 61 billion yuan this year and grow more than sevenfold to 220.1 billion yuan in 2018, according to estimates last month from iResearch. Tencent's advertising business, however, faces fierce competition from China's two other Internet majors--search provider Baidu Inc. and e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. In the market for online advertising including both PC and mobile ads, Baidu is the leading platform with a 34% share, followed by Alibaba's 22% and Tencent's 5.3%, according to iResearch. But analysts said they expect Tencent to expand its market share as more online advertising dollars shift to mobile. Tencent said WeChat's monthly active users increased to 549 million in March from 500 million in December. WeChat can be an attractive platform for advertisers, as its users tend to open the app many times a day, not just to communicate with friends but to play games, find restaurants and hail taxis. ""Tencent has all the ingredients"" to build a successful mobile ad business, said Jefferies analyst Cynthia Meng, citing WeChat's vast user base, frequency of usage as well as the amount of time users spend in each session. ""The question is how fast it will happen."" BNP Paribas analyst Vey-Sern Ling forecast Tencent's total advertising revenue to nearly double this year to 16.24 billion yuan from 8.31 billion yuan last year, accounting for 16.2% of the company's overall revenue this year, compared with 10.5% last year. Tencent said its first-quarter net profit rose to 6.88 billion yuan from 6.46 billion yuan a year earlier. Revenue rose 22% to 22.4 billion from 18.4 billion yuan. The company said revenue from smartphone games rose 82% from a year earlier to about 4.4 billion yuan in the first quarter. The business segment consisting mainly of games accounted for 83% of Tencent's revenue. Another potential source of future growth for Tencent is mobile payments, a segment that has so far been dominated by Alibaba's Alipay payment affiliate. Last year, Alipay accounted for 82% of China's mobile payment transactions, while Tencent's payment system accounted for 11%, according to iResearch. Since last year, Tencent has been trying harder to get more people to use its mobile-payment system. WeChat last year launched a feature that allows users to send virtual red envelopes stuffed with cash to their families, friends and colleagues, which is a Lunar New Year tradition. Tencent said the feature, as well as taxi-hailing, helped generate more transactions for its mobile-payment system, though the company didn't disclose specific figures.

TCEHY	Chinese Internet major Tencent Holdings Ltd. (0700.HK) said Wednesday that its net profit for the first quarter rose 7% from a year earlier, helped by growth in revenue from mobile games and advertising. Still, the rate of earnings growth marked a significant slowdown compared with the fourth quarter, when net profit jumped 50% year-over-year. Tencent, whose main services are online games and social networks, said its net profit increased to 6.88 billion yuan ($1.1 billion) from 6.46 billion yuan a year earlier. Revenue rose 22% to 22.4 billion from 18.4 billion yuan a year earlier. Operating profit for the quarter rose 20% to 9.37 billion yuan from 7.79 billion yuan a year earlier. The quarterly earnings beat analysts' expectations for a profit of 6.45 billion yuan, based on a survey by S&P Capital IQ. Tencent, a dominant player in online games played on personal computers, has been expanding its mobile presence through games it distributes via its popular smartphone messaging apps. Tencent's WeChat messaging app had 549 million monthly active users in March, the company said. Revenue from smartphone games rose 82% from a year earlier to about 4.4 billion yuan in the first quarter, Tencent said. While the business segment consisting mainly of games accounted for 83% of Tencent's revenue in the quarter, analysts and investors are closely watching the company's advertising revenue. They hope this will become another major source of growth in the coming years as Tencent turns WeChat into an advertising platform. In the first quarter, Tencent's online advertising revenue more than doubled from a year earlier to 2.72 billion yuan.

TCEHY	Warner Music Group Corp. said it swung to a profit in the March quarter on a strong release schedule. The company reported growth in streaming revenue, which surpassed download revenue for the first time. While the industry's focus has shifted away from CDs, Warner said it posted strong growth in physical sales, driven by Kid Rock and Led Zeppelin albums and releases from local artists in territories with strong physical-format sales. Warner, the third-largest music company behind Vivendi SA's Universal Music Group and Sony Corp.'s Sony Music Entertainment, is owned by Len Blavatnik's Access Industries Inc. The company has been active in striking deals to expand its online distribution. An agreement announced with German audio-sharing website SoundCloud Ltd. made Warner the first major label to start earning money from the site. Also in November, Warner signed a deal with Tencent Holdings Ltd. to expand its online music distribution in China. In recent quarters, currency issues have weighed on the New York-based company's results. For the period ended March 31, Warner Music posted a profit of $18 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of $60 million. Earnings excluding items were $23 million, compared with a loss excluding items of $26 million a year earlier. Revenue increased 4% to $677 million. Excluding currency effects, revenue rose 13%. Digital revenue grew 10% excluding currency impact, while recorded music sales improved 15% on that basis.

TCEHY	Bloomberg Hong Kong and Shanghai stocks rise for a second session. HONG KONG (MarketWatch) — Chinese stocks gained Monday for the second session in a row, bolstered by the third rate cut from the Chinese central bank in six months.

TCEHY	"NEW DELHI--After four years of selling smartphones at prices close to what they cost to produce, Xiaomi Corp. says the model is paying off. The Chinese smartphone maker expects revenue from mobile services--such as games and a payment app--that it sells to more than triple this year to nearly $1 billion, said Lei Jun, Xiaomi's chairman, in an interview on Friday. If Xiaomi hits this target, it would make mobile services a more significant, though still relatively small, source of revenue for the company, which was founded five years ago. Xiaomi has long said its ambition is to be an Internet giant, not a handset peddler. The company became the world's most valuable technology startup at the end of last year, according to a tally by The Wall Street Journal, boosted by investors' hopes that it can turn its millions of smartphone buyers into paying customers for entertainment and financial and other services. Xiaomi has previously said it expects to have total revenue of $16 billion in 2015, so $1 billion from mobile services would account for about 6%. Last year, Mr. Lei said, it made less than $300 million in revenue from services. The company doesn't disclose information about its profitability. A document obtained by the Journal last year showed that the offshore company controlling Xiaomi's business had net income of 3.46 billion yuan ($559 million) in 2013. As Xiaomi aims to expand outside China this year, Mr. Lei said the company is also making efforts to localize data storage for international users, amid growing consumer concerns about tech companies' data security. In the interview, following the launch of a phone aimed at Indian consumers, Mr. Lei cited Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and games-and-chat Internet conglomerate Tencent Holdings Ltd. as its future competitors. ""The ways that Tencent and Alibaba make money today are the ways that Xiaomi will make money in the future,"" he said. Xiaomi started as a lean manufacturer of smartphones for bargain prices. The company sells its phones mainly online to cut costs and relies on social media and word-of-mouth for advertising. Last year, it became China's largest smartphone maker by units shipped, according to market-research firm IDC. Mr. Lei said users' privacy was very important to the company and it was building data centers outside of China. Cloud services for Indian consumers will be run from an India-based data center by the end of this year, he said. ""If we want to go global, we must respect every country's regulations and laws,"" he said. ""We must respect every user's habits."" Beijing is examining several draft laws this year that would require companies to share data with the Chinese government for counterterrorism and other purposes. India is a major focus for Xiaomi's ambitions to expand outside of China, and its first phone aimed at global users was launched in New Delhi on Thursday. Xiaomi will open a research center in India this year and the company is investigating the feasibility of moving some of its phone manufacturing to the country, said Manu Jain, Xiaomi's India head.

TCEHY	HONG KONG (MarketWatch) — Hong Kong stocks eked out gains on Wednesday, returning to the advance after snapping an eight-day win streak on Tuesday. But the gains were capped after data showed China’s economic growth declined to a six-year low in the first quarter. The Hang Seng Index HSI, +1.35%  recovered 0.2% to 27,618.82, after retreating on Tuesday from a seven-year high of 28,016.34. The mainland-China-tracking Hang Seng China Enterprises HSCEI, +1.01%  rose 1.5%. Official data released Wednesday showed China’s gross domestic product grew 7% in the first quarter — the slowest pace since 2009. Still, the figure matched forecasts in a Reuters survey and exceeded an estimated 6.9% increase in a Wall Street Journal poll. Meanwhile, industrial output and retail sales both recorded weaker-than-expected growth in March. On the mainland itself, Shanghai markets halted a three-day run, with the Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, +0.08%  pulling back 1.2%. Mainland Chinese banks posted broad-based gains, with Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd.  1398, +0.45% IDCBF, -2.35% 601398, -0.51%  jumping 4.9%, China Construction Bank Corp. 0939, +0.76% CICHF, -2.94% 601939, -0.54%   climbing 4.4%, Bank of Communications Co. 3328, +0.81% BKFCF, -14.29% 601328, -0.16%   rising 4.3%, and Bank of China Ltd. 3988, +0.96% BACHY, -3.10% 601988, -0.26%  higher by 3.6%. The biggest gainer, Alibaba Health Information Technology Ltd. 0241, +2.58%  , soared 80.8%, after parent Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, -2.93%  said it would transfer its Tmall online-pharmacy business to Alibaba Health in exchange for $2.5 billion worth of shares and convertible debt. After the deal, Alibaba Group’s stake in the health-care company would be set to increase to more than 50%, making it a consolidated subsidiary. On the downside, online major Tencent Holdings Ltd. 0700, +1.48% TCEHY, -2.58%   extended previous losses to decline 2.2%. Fellow index heavyweight China Mobile Ltd. 0941, +2.38% CHL, +0.31%   also retreated, dropping 2.7%. Other Asian markets were mostly weaker, with Japan’s Nikkei Average NIK, +0.51%  slipping 0.2% and the broader Topix I0000, +0.38%  drifting 0.1% lower. The yen USDJPY, +0.19%  softened, with the greenback buying ¥119.56, compared with ¥119.40 late Tuesday in New York. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 XJO, +0.35%  shed 0.6%, while South Korea’s Kospi Composite Index SEU, +0.60%  notched a 0.4% gain.

TCEHY	"A surge of cash from mainland China into Hong Kong stocks has mostly found its way into companies little known to global investors, a development already starting to alter the city's market. Mainland investors have plowed a net 26.4 billion yuan ($4.25 billion) into stocks traded in the former British colony since Wednesday, sending shares of Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies skyrocketing and the city's share-trading volumes to record highs. But blue-chip perennials, names such as HSBC Holdings PLC, CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. and Swire Pacific Ltd., weren't among the 10 most traded by mainland investors. Instead, these investors have focused on company names recognized in China, or firms that are dual listed and trade at a wide discount in Hong Kong. Firms such as Hanergy Thin Film Power Group Ltd. and Golden Eagle Retail Group Ltd. have attracted significant turnover through the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, which links the two stock exchanges. For these Chinese buyers, the hope is to avoid big blue-chip stocks widely held by international investors. Mainland investors fear that their smaller influence could be quickly overwhelmed, said Wang Zhihua, chief investment officer and portfolio manager of CSOP's China New Balance Opportunity Fund, a mainland asset manager. ""Chinese investors are aware that the pricing power of large-cap in Hong Kong is controlled by institutional investors, especially overseas investors,"" he said. ""So generally, the investors coming from mainland China would trade small-cap instead of large-cap."" Hong Kong Stock Exchange Chief Executive Charles Li, in a blog post published Thursday, said that mainland investors bring ""differences in investment values, risk awareness and regulatory cultures."" In a message that appeared designed to cool some of last week's trading passions, he said their arrival ""will bring new challenges and risks to Hong Kong investors, particularly retail ones. Staying calm and exercising caution in a more active market will be a challenge to each investor in Hong Kong."" That said, most of the mainland trading hitting Hong Kong's market smacks of common sense. Many Chinese traders are simply buying familiar firms that aren't listed on the mainland and had been out of reach for these investors. This has left foreign fund managers and brokers saying they are trying to figure out what will be the next hot stock among buyers tapping the market through Stock Connect. ""Chinese investors may go for brands they are familiar with,"" said Winner Lee, Asia equity derivatives strategist at BNP Paribas SA. These include electronics retailer GOME Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd. and Internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd., which operates the popular WeChat instant messaging app. Shares of GOME Electrical Appliances, one of two leading Chinese electronics retailers, rose 46% in the last three days of last week. It was the most-traded stock by mainland investors via Stock Connect on Friday. Compared with its Shenzhen-listed rival Suning Appliance Co., it still looks cheap, according to Jingwen Wang, an analyst at Haitong International Research Ltd. ""Suning trades at a forward [price-to-earnings ratio] of about 100 times, versus GOME which, before the rally, was at roughly 12 times forward P/E,"" said Ms. Wang. The trading is also about capturing the valuation gap between stocks listed both in Hong Kong and China. Hong Kong equities trade at an average discount of 23.4% to the their mainland counterparts, even after last week's rally, which boosted the Hang Seng Index by 7.9%. Hong Kong-listed shares of power company Shanghai Electric Group Co. Ltd. and chemical producer China Molybdenum Co. Ltd., two of the top-traded companies by mainlanders via Stock Connect, were trading at a discount of 49% before the rally. There is also a self-reinforcing dynamic. Mainland investors are buying Chinese brokerage stocks such as Haitong International Securities Group Ltd. and Citic Securities Co. Ltd., reasoning that their business will boom as a result of the Connect program. Two mainland blue chips that surged were railway giants CSR Corp. Ltd. and China CNR Corp. Ltd., which each rose more than 18% after they announced they received regulatory approval from Beijing to merge. Mainland investors scooped up the stocks, making CSR the top traded company through Stock Connect on Wednesday and Thursday. It was among the top five Friday. ""Hong Kong's market may become more sensitive to Chinese policies in the future,"" said Ms. Lee of BNP. William Fong, a fund manager at Baring Asset Management, said mainland investors are astute about their local economy, and invest accordingly. Sectors that aren't growing, such as the tightly regulated global banking industry, are unlikely to attract Chinese investment. ""The mainland investor is not stupid,"" he said. ""We can't just rely on what the mainlander is thinking."" Write to Gregor Stuart Hunter at gregor.hunter@wsj.com Access Investor Kit for GOME Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd.

TCEHY	Reuters Takeshi Idezawa, the incoming chief executive officer of Line Corp. TOKYO — The year 2015 is shaping up as a make-or-break one for the global ambitions of Line Corp., which operates a smartphone messaging application that is wildly popular in Japan but faces tough competition from bigger rivals elsewhere, its new chief executive said. “In the rapidly changing industry, a door for growth won’t remain open for a long time,” said Takeshi Idezawa, who will take over as CEO in April, in a recent interview. But he said the company wasn’t about to revive plans for an initial public stock offering, which were put on hold last year. Line’s green-themed app, which offers messaging, games and a range of other smartphone-based services, has become a major means of communication for young people in Japan. The company, which generates revenue from sales of games, digital “stickers” that users append to messages, e-commerce and other services, was profitable in 2014, only its fourth year in business, Mr. Idezawa said, declining to provide specific figures. Worldwide, Line, owned by South Korean Internet portal operator Naver Corp. 035420, +0.26%  , boasted 181 million monthly active users as of the end of last year. But about half of them are in Japan and two other Asian countries: Taiwan and Thailand. The company earns the vast majority of its revenue domestically. Globally, Line trails several other messaging apps, including Facebook Inc.’s FB, -1.34%  WhatsApp, which has more than 700 million monthly active users, Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s 0700, +1.48% TCEHY, -2.58%  WeChat with more than 460 million, and even Japanese rival Rakuten Inc.’s 4755, -2.86% RKUNF, +0.00%  Viber unit, with 236 million monthly active users.

TCEHY	Bloomberg Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has signed a digital music distribution deal in China with BMG, the music division of Germany’s Bertelsmann, as the e-commerce giant and its Chinese rivals race to beef up their online entertainment offerings. Under the agreement, Alibaba BABA, -2.93%  will promote BMG’s music and artists in China through its online platforms such as the Xiami music streaming service. Alibaba will also monitor and take action against infringements of BMG’s rights in China, BMG BTG, +1.00%  said in a statement. The companies didn’t disclosed the financial terms of the deal. Alibaba’s partnership with BMG follows similar agreements in China last year between Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY, -2.58% Alibaba’s chief Internet rival, and global music companies. In December, Tencent announced an exclusive online distribution deal with Sony Corp.’s SNE, -1.44%  Sony Music Entertainment for the Chinese market, after signing a similar deal with Warner Music Group in November. To bolster its positions in this area, Alibaba has made some acquisitions. Last year, Alibaba took a 16.5% stake in online video firm Youku Tudou Inc. US:YOKU  and bought a 60% stake in Chinese film production firm ChinaVision Media Group, changing its name to Alibaba Pictures Group. An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.

TCEHY	TOKYO (MarketWatch) — Last year, China’s Alibaba Group unleashed a monster of an IPO, the world’s biggest to date. But this year, Japan has a monster of its own that by all accounts could blow past the Alibaba listing to become the most massive offering of stock ever seen. It is easily the hottest topic around the boardrooms and izakayas (after-work drinking halls) across Tokyo: the highly anticipated initial public offering of Japan Post Holdings, the finance-ministry-held behemoth that combines the national postal service with the country’s biggest savings bank and major insurer. Its financial arm alone had ¥205 trillion ($1.71 trillion) worth of assets under management as of December, roughly one-third the entire annual GDP of Japan. The offering has been more than a decade in the making, surviving fierce political controversy since the idea of privatization was first introduced. The issue was a sensitive one because not only does Japan Post bring in a massive amount of revenue, but also it’s the nation’s largest employer. Finally, with the government determined to shore up Japan’s debt-bedraggled finances, the stock appears ready to go to market sometime this autumn, with the ministry having set a goal of ¥4 trillion yen, or about $33 billion, for the divestment proceeds. It has earmarked the funds for rebuilding parts of northeastern Japan destroyed by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Such an amount would dwarf Alibaba’s BABA, -2.93%  $25 billion haul — to date the largest in history. Still, much of the details have yet to surface, and according to the Nikkei Asian Review, the event may come as a trio of listings: Japan Post Holdings, along with separate tickers for its subsidiaries Japan Post Bank and Japan Post Insurance. Likewise, some reckonings see the issue as pulling in a somewhat more modest $10 billion-$20 billion. In discussing the big Japan Post sale, those with longer memories note similarities with the situation a quarter-century ago, when the government privatized its fixed-line carrier, Nippon Telegraph & Telephone 9432, +1.36% US:NTT Unusually for Japan, its listing was a big event not just for institutions, but for retail investors as well. “In 1990, NTT went public, and I think it was the same situation” as now, says Masaki Kai, the founder and chief executive of Tokyo investor-relations firm FinanTec. “This is a positive thing,” says Kai, who also runs the bilingual website TokyoIPO.com. “When Japan Post goes public, people who are not interested in equity markets will become interested in them.” And Japan Post isn’t the only potential stock-market debutante with mass appeal. Among other stars likely to list in Tokyo this year is Line Corp., the maker of Japan’s most widely used free-call and messaging app, often compared with Facebook Inc.’s FB, -1.34%  WhatsApp and Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s 0700, +1.43% TCEHY, -2.58%  WeChat. Line — currently a wholly owned subsidiary of South Korean Internet company Naver Corp. 035420, +0.26% NHNCF, +0.00%  — has proved adept at monetizing its content. For example, it does brisk sales in its virtual “stickers,” which users can send in lieu of emoji, to the tune of $323 million in 2013, according to The Wall Street Journal. In fact, the stickers have become so popular that the company even opened up a brick-and-mortar “Line Friends Store” in central Tokyo where users can purchase physical versions of the official seals they send digitally. How meta. Line had planned to list last year but later decided the timing wasn’t right. According to the Nikkei, one of the possible issues delaying an IPO was internal debate over whether to list simultaneously in the U.S. and Japan. As with Japan Post, the familiarity of Line could spark considerable retail interest. This is not usually the case, notes NHK World Newsline reporter Mayu Yoshida. While “buzz” is a regular feature of IPOs in the U.S., at least if they are of a significant size, Japan greets most new offerings with a yawn. But this year, the potential market debutantes “are definitely more eye-catching than in previous years,” Yoshida says, citing talks that theme park Universal Studios Japan (USJ) might also go to market soon. “It’s very popular in Japan,” FinanTec’s Kai says of privately held USJ, which operates under license from Comcast Corp.’s CMCSA, -1.39%  NBCUniversal. “They had gone public in 2006 and then went private in 2009. Now, they are relisting their brand. … Harry Potter is still popular, so maybe they will get a good valuation.” Kai also tips a likely IPO from the capital’s light-rail operator Tokyo Metro Co., which first applied last year for a listing — a move that would allow them to secure funding for major upgrades and infrastructure improvements. “It’s a good story for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics,” says Kai. “I think they will probably announce within this year.” MarketWatch/Jeff Richards Popular messaging-app provider – and merchandiser – Line Corp. is among the potential major IPOs expected in Japan this year.

TCEHY	"Tencent Holdings Ltd.'s 50% profit growth in the fourth quarter showed its continued dependence on online games. A big challenge for the Chinese Internet giant is how to build new sources of revenue through its messaging and social-networking services. Investors and analysts see a potential gold mine in Tencent's WeChat and QQ messaging and social-networking services, which have hundreds of millions of active users in China, where major U.S. services such as Facebook and Twitter are blocked. So far, Tencent has been generating some of its revenue by offering mobile games through WeChat and QQ, and has added new advertising features to those social platforms. Still, Tencent's profit for the three months through December, which came a little below analyst expectations, was a reminder that the company still has a long way to go to cash in on the popularity of WeChat and QQ. The company, based in Shenzhen, China said Wednesday its net profit rose 50% to 5.86 billion yuan ($937 million) from 3.91 billion yuan a year earlier. Its revenue rose 24% to 20.98 billion yuan from 16.97 billion yuan a year earlier. In the same quarter, the number of users for Tencent's social platforms continued to grow. QQ's active users on smartphones and tablets increased to 576 million in December from 542 million in September, the company said, while active users of WeChat, which is called Weixin in mainland China, grew to 500 million from 468 million over the same period. Tencent's revenue from online games, including those played on personal computers as well as smartphones and tablets, rose 41% to 11.96 billion yuan in the quarter. Mobile games offered through WeChat and QQ generated 2.9 billion yuan in revenue in the fourth quarter, rising from 2.6 billion yuan in the third quarter but at a slower rate of growth than some analysts had projected. Other than the social platforms, Tencent also distributes mobile games through app stores. At a news conference Wednesday, Tencent executives said China's mobile games market is still developing. ""If you look at the number of players for mobile games, it's actually much higher than players of PC games...but the percentage of people who pay is actually still quite small compared to PCs,"" Tencent President Martin Lau said. ""There's still quite a bit of head room to grow."" In addition to typical mobile games that are basic and easy to play, Tencent is offering more sophisticated, engaging titles such as shooting games that could get more people to spend money while playing, Chief Strategy Officer James Mitchell said. investors are hoping that Tencent will keep developing new sources of revenue on top of mobile games. ""Mobile games' growth is already priced in. The upside (for Tencent shares) will likely depend on advertising revenue,"" Jefferies analyst Cynthia Meng said earlier this week. In the fourth quarter, 82% of Tencent's revenue came from online games, while advertising revenue accounted for only 13%. Tencent has been gradually adding more advertising features to WeChat and QQ. In January, in mainland China, the company added sponsored posts to WeChat's ""moments"" section, a Facebook-like section where users share photos and other status updates. Last year, Tencent launched a service in China in which companies that have WeChat accounts can pay fees to place ads on other corporate WeChat pages. ""Facebook has been able to build a very large advertising business on a social network,"" Mr. Lau said, adding that the factors that make Facebook's advertising successful also apply to Tencent's social networks in China. ""Advertising will be a major contributor to our revenue."" Mr. Lau said that the company will have to find the right balance to grow its ad revenue without sacrificing user experience. Carine Chu, a 28-year-old consultant in Beijing who uses WeChat to talk to friends, colleagues and clients, said she started noticing sponsored feeds on WeChat about a month ago. ""I don't really find them annoying. I just ignore them,"" she said. In a note to clients last week, Barclays analyst Alicia Yap projected that revenue from WeChat's sponsored feeds would reach about 1.89 billion yuan this year and increase sharply next year to 10.2 billion to account for 42% of Tencent's total advertising revenue. Another challenge for Tencent is intensifying competition from other Internet giants in China. Tencent, e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and search provider Baidu Inc. are expanding their businesses through acquisitions and stepping into each other's turf. Still, Tencent recently shook hands with Alibaba when rival Chinese taxi-hailing companies Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache, separately backed by Tencent and Alibaba, agreed last month to merge in a rare deal that brought together the two Internet giants. ""We are competitors, and at the same time, we can be partners,"" Tencent Chief Executive Pony Ma said Wednesday. In some areas Tencent can work with its competitors, and ""there are many such areas,"" he said. Write to Juro Osawa at juro.osawa@wsj.com Access Investor Kit for Tencent Holdings Ltd.

TCEHY	Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi is the latest tech company to cross over into financial services. Xiaomi began public beta testing Tuesday of an online money-market fund that lets users earn interest on money saved in Xiaomi’s wallet app, a spokeswoman said. It marks another sign of Xiaomi’s ambitions to be an Internet company rivaling Alibaba Group BABA, -2.93%  and Tencent Holdings TCEHY, -2.58%  , rather than just a hardware maker. China e-commerce giant Alibaba launched its Yu’e Bao online fund management platform in June 2013, and it became the fourth-largest money market fund in the world at one point last year. The annual yield for Xiaomi’s fund is currently 6.4%, according to a microblog post by Xiaomi marketing chief Tony Wei. Yu’e Bao’s yield has fallen to 4.5% as of Tuesday, although it was over 6% in its early days. It isn’t clear whether Xiaomi’s higher rate would remain should the company make the program permanent. Also this week, Facebook FB, -1.34%  added a payment feature to its Messenger app that let users send cash to friends. Such a function had already been offered by Chinese Internet companies like Tencent, with Chinese users early adaptors of mobile payments. As for Xiaomi’s fund, it is still in beta testing, so there are no guarantees it will be a permanent feature. But it’s an indication of Xiaomi’s direction as it looks beyond smartphone sales. The company has grown into the world’s most valuable startup due to online sales of smartphones with high-end specs and low price tags. Xiaomi executives have long said they are more interested in building a large userbase than in short-term profits from the phones so they can deploy more Internet services.

TCEHY	"Tencent Holdings Ltd., one of China's largest Internet companies, said its net profit rose 50% in the fourth quarter of last year, helped by solid revenue from online games. As investors had already been counting on the strength of the company's game business, the next big question for Tencent is how it plans to expand its advertising revenue through its popular mobile messaging and social networking apps, analysts say. The Shenzhen-based company said Wednesday its net profit for the three months through December rose to 5.86 billion yuan ($937 million) from 3.91 billion yuan a year earlier. Its revenue rose 24% to 20.98 billion yuan from 16.97 billion yuan a year ago. Its revenue from online games, including those played on PCs as well as smartphones and tablets, rose 41% to 11.96 billion yuan. The company said the growth was fueled by the strength of mobile games. Tencent's mobile games faced a temporary slowdown in the third quarter because of delays in upgrades to some games, but the issue has since been resolved. Analysts forecast continued growth in revenue from games in the coming quarters and expect mobile advertising to make larger contributions to revenue. ""Mobile games' growth is already priced in. The upside (for Tencent shares) will likely depend on advertising revenue,"" Jefferies analyst Cynthia Meng said earlier this week. Investors and analysts see a potential gold mine in Tencent's popular WeChat and QQ messaging and social-networking services, which serve as platforms for lucrative businesses such as mobile games and advertisement.

TCEHY	"Sina Corp. said fourth-quarter earnings soared on investment-related gains and higher revenue driven by advertising growth at the Chinese online media company's Weibo Corp. unit. Sina, an early pioneer of the Chinese Internet, and Weibo are battling with much larger companies-including Alibaba, Internet conglomerate Tencent Holdings Ltd. and search provider Baidu Inc. to dominate the Chinese Internet sector. Weibo, which went public in the U.S. in April but remains controlled by Sina, allows users to publish brief public messages to followers who can repost them, similar to Twitter. Chief Executive Charles Chao said ""As we enter into 2015, we are excited about the various opportunities unfolding ahead of us on both Weibo and portal sides. We are also confident that our initiatives in revamping our legacy business will start to take shape and form the foundation for longer term growth."" For the 2015, Sina projected revenue, excluding effects of deferred license revenue, between $800 million and $900 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected $885 million. Overall, Sina reported a profit of $59.8 million, or 90 cents a share, up from $44.5 million, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding stock-based compensation, gains related to investments and other items, earnings fell to 24 cents from 47 cents. Analysts expected per-share profit of 18 cents. Revenue increased 7.2% to $211.1 million. Adjusted to exclude deferred license revenue effects, revenue rose 8% to $208.5 million, above the midpoint of company expectations for $204 million to $210 million. Advertising revenue improved 14% to $181.9 million as an increase in Weibo advertising revenue was offset by a decline in portal revenue. Operating expenses surged to $132.9 million from $99.5 million a year earlier, reflecting higher personnel costs, marketing expenditures and bad debt expenses.

TCEHY	"SHANGHAI--Two Chinese real estate agencies are joining with larger partners as the country's brokerages grapple with the lingering property downturn as well as new technologies upending the business. 58.com Inc. -- the Chinese equivalent of Craigslist Inc., backed by Internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. -- said Monday that it had acquired Shanghai-based property-listing platform Anjuke Inc. for about $267 million in cash and shares. It marked the latest deal in China's fast-growing market for services that connect online users with traditional local offline businesses. Also on Monday, Homelink Real Estate Agency Co., Beijing's largest real estate agency by market share, will combine with Shanghai Deovolente Realty Co., according to the Shanghai-based company. Homelink, which is much larger than Deovolente in terms of employees and outlets, characterized the deal as a merger but didn't disclose terms. Since 2011, property agencies have weathered a volatile property market and the rise of China's e-commerce companies. Conditions have worsened since 2013 because of a huge supply of homes, especially in smaller cities. Housing sales in China fell 7.8% nationwide in 2014, and home prices in many smaller cities declined significantly, squeezing profits for property agencies. In February, average home prices in 100 Chinese cities fell 3.8% from a year earlier, the fifth straight month of year-over-year declines, according to private sector data provider China Real Estate Index System, an arm of SouFun Holdings Ltd. Last year, more than a dozen property agencies including Deovolente and Homelink announced a boycott of China's largest real estate Internet portal, SouFun, arguing that it charged unfair prices for listings on its website. SouFun disputes the accusations and said it is continuing to provide their customers with the best service. In January, Chinese real estate agency Century 21 China Real Estate was delisted by the New York Stock Exchange after it failed to maintain required market capitalization levels. The company has said the delisting won't deter it from increasing its business. 58.com said revenue growth from the housing sector slowed in the third quarter as a result of the housing slump. Some real estate agencies cut down the number of branches and online marketing expenses, said Zhou Hao, 58.com's chief financial officer, according a transcript of a company conference call. Anjuke, which was founded in 2007, sees 66 million unique visitors to its site each month, according to its website. Anjuke covers 67 cities in China and said it would continue to operate its website and mobile application under the Anjuke brand. Deovolente, the Shanghai brokerage, said that after its combination with Homelink, the combined company would be called ""New Homelink."" The combined firm will focus on developing its online-to-offline marketing strategies, the Deovolente statement said. Homelink will combine its 1,800 storefront outlets, and 35,000 staff with Deovolente's more than 200 storefronts and 5,000 staff, it said. Juro Osawa in Hong Kong contributed to this article.

TCEHY	BOSTON — Look out for the bonds of big foreign countries, especially in Europe. Prices have boomed, but investors are on a hiding to nothing. There’s a good chance they’ll lose money, and some chance we’ll even see a sharp sell off. So, at least, says Ben Inker , the co-head of asset allocation at GMO, the famous white-shoe Boston money management firm, and one of the wiser heads in the investment world. On a morning when the temperature in Boston fell below that of Fargo, N.D., and Anchorage, Alaska, I picked my way through the ice and bitter winds to get the latest financial forecasts from Inker at the GMO headquarters down by the harbor. And some of Inker’s outlook seemed as Arctic as the weather outside. GMO LLC Ben Inker Financial forecasts are generally about as reliable as weather forecasts in New England, but those made by GMO are worth some attention, for two reasons. Firstly, their “forecasts” rely more on past history and current valuations than they do on trying to read a crystal ball. Secondly, GMO has the record of having successfully anticipated the crashes of 2000-2003 and 2007-2009. GMO is now betting heavily against bonds issued in the eurozone and elsewhere, Inker said. Prices are too high, he says, and yields are too low. (Bonds are like seesaws: When the price goes up, the yield goes down). Thirty-year German bonds TMBMKDE-30Y, +0.34%  , known as bunds, sport yields of barely 1%. Long-term bonds issued by countries such as the Netherlands, France, or Japan are little better. Investors who own these bonds are taking bigger risks than they may realize, he said. They are basically betting that short-term interest rates in these countries will stay 0% for years, maybe even decades, to come. Good luck with that, as people say. That’s not all. GMO is also predicting icy returns from many other investments as well. That includes the more fashionable stocks on Wall Street — where the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -2.34%  just hit a new high — and overseas. So where should MarketWatch readers, and other investors, look for opportunities for our portfolios? Look at emerging markets, says Inker. But don’t look at the hot stocks, such as China’s booming Alibaba BABA, -2.93%  or Tencent 0700, +1.38%  . TCEHY, -2.58%  Look instead at the unfashionable and unloved “value” stocks, such as Korean industrials or Brazilian utilities. Inker thinks a broad portfolio of such stocks could beat inflation by around 7% a year over the next seven years — meaning it will gain value in real terms by around 60%. (And that’s not even counting returns from hard-hit commodity stocks). Obvious but important caveat: This is only a forecast, and is far from certain. It’s based on current valuations and some basic assumptions about the future. All stocks are risky, and emerging markets can be especially so. Time and chance will happen to them all. Inker can’t talk names, but according to filings, GMO’s biggest emerging-market stock holdings as of Dec. 31 included Samsung Electronics 005930, +1.57% three Chinese banks (China Construction Bank Corp. CICHY, -2.39% 601939, -0.54%   , Industrial & Commercial Bank of China 601398, -0.17%  , and Bank of China BACHF, +1.87% 601988, -0.52%  ), China Mobile XE:CTM  , and a couple of Russian gas companies: Surgutneftegaz RU:SNGS   and Gazprom RU:GAZP  ). Ordinary investors who want to follow suit are probably best advised to steer clear of individual emerging-markets stocks and instead use a low-cost, broadly based mutual fund. Two good emerging-markets value exchange-traded funds are PowerShares’ FTSE RAFI Emerging Markets Index fund PXH, -1.92%   and iShares’ Emerging Markets Value US:EVAL Both have expenses of 0.49% of assets per year. How much should a normal person wager on such investments? Emerging markets are risky. Even where clients have given GMO a free hand, Inker says the firm has put only about 18% of its equity portfolio in emerging markets. He expects that to rise to around 25%. As the firm has only put half its portfolio in equities, it suggests the sensible long-term investor might think about putting somewhere between 10% and 13% of their portfolio in emerging-market value stocks.

TCEHY	BEIJING (Caixin Online) — China’s central bank, UnionPay bank-card service and e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, -2.93%  are standing up to Apple Inc.’s AAPL, -2.56%  effort to bring the Apple Pay no-card-no-cash payment system to iPhone users in China.  ABOUT CAIXIN Caixin is a Beijing-based media group dedicated to providing high-quality and authoritative financial and business news and information through periodicals, online and TV/video programs. • Get the Caixin e-newsletter “Apple is seeking to cooperate with Chinese financial institutions” including banks for the use of Apple Pay, a People’s Bank of China (PBOC) official said. At the same time, the American company has not yet “acknowledged regulators,” and as a result, “it’s unclear whether the product meets the government’s requirements” for a commercial operation. Apple is also struggling with its relationship with UnionPay, China’s state-owned credit- and debit-card system operator. Sources close to the companies said that talks aimed at an agreement that would open China to Apple Pay have stalled. The central bank official who asked not to be named said regulators have not intervened in negotiations between Apple and UnionPay, which began last year and were reportedly aimed at an agreement by March. Apple Pay was launched for commercial use in the United States about a month after the September release of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S handsets. By swiping an iPhone at a checkout counter, an Apple Pay customer in the U.S. can complete a transaction quickly through a wireless link to his or her bank account or credit card. Apple is reportedly working toward expanding this service globally. But it is unclear whether the Apple Pay feature will be allowed in China, one of Apple’s biggest markets, anytime soon. Apple Pay relies on near-field communication (NFC), a wireless system that transmits data from a special chip-equipped smartphone to a bank through a point-of-sale (POS) reader at a checkout counter. A UnionPay-linked NFC system has been around for about two years, letting consumers with Chinese bank accounts shop with smartphones equipped with China Mobile 0941, +2.38% CHL, +0.31%  or China Unicom 0762, +1.40% CHU, +0.47%  SIM cards. Separately, some consumers are using smartphones to make payments through quick-response (QR) code systems linked to Alibaba Group’s Alipay, Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s 0700, +1.33% TCEHY, -2.58%  WePay and other mobile application services. Apple Pay has hit bumps in China despite Apple’s efforts to make friends with Alibaba and UnionPay. Industry observers had hoped for an agreement after Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook and Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma said separately in October their companies were in cooperation talks. Speculation ran high that Apple Pay might find a way to access China by using Alipay instead of UnionPay to process iPhone owner transactions. Alipay’s app uses a fingerprint password that, underscoring their corporate friendship, was jointly developed by Alibaba and Apple, apparently with a view to building a cooperative payment system in the future, said an Alipay employee who requested anonymity. The companies “have stayed in contact and are preparing for several projects,” the employee said. But Alipay has yet to find a way to work around the UnionPay system, which is the sole channel for NFC transactions in China and sets rates for settlement fees paid by merchants. UnionPay’s control of this system thus stands in the way of a potential Apple Pay-Alipay deal. The rate charged by UnionPay to users of the NFC system “is a heavy price to pay for Alipay. We don’t have an offline settlement system, and expensive POS equipment is unaffordable to us,” said the Alipay source. Chen Jianwei, director of the mobile finance department of Zhongyintong Payment Co., a UnionPay affiliate that provides payment services, said Alipay is doing no more than “supporting offline payments in some grocery stores and vending machines using QR codes.” Standards and profits UnionPay is holding its ground despite a November agreement whereby Apple started accepting consumer payments through UnionPay at its stores in China. UnionPay’s NFC system is indeed “technologically compatible with Apple Pay,” said one analyst. To qualify for access to any NFC system in China, according to regulators with the central bank, Apple Pay must comply with a central bank rule that restricts electronic payment systems to those using chips that meet a technical standard called PBOC 3.0. A source familiar with Apple Pay said iPhone chips that drive the payment system do not fully comply with this standard. Indeed, regulators who studied Apple Pay raised concerns about compliance with Chinese regulations and security standards. The Chinese government has also told Apple that as a condition for Apple Pay, the company must open a mainland China data center to house all Chinese customer-related information tied to Apply Pay clients, said an official at the central bank. This rule is in step with the country’s data-security standards, which are designed to “prevent data leaks” and keep the Chinese payment system running smoothly if technical problems arise at a data center overseas. Some industry watchers say Apple is also facing headwinds because UnionPay does not want to lose the power it has over financial transactions. “Letting Apple Pay enter China will have a profound impact” on the payment market, said a financial-sector source. “For UnionPay, cooperating with Apple means opening its settlement system. It would be hard to say who’s in control.” “UnionPay definitely wants to keep a grip on the system,” the person said. Sources close to the talks between Apple and Chinese banks with which it’s negotiating say these discussions are revolving around how the U.S. company might cooperate with UnionPay. The talks, which started late last year, involve at least eight banks including China Merchants Bank 3968, +0.48% CIHHF, -7.11% 600036, +0.07%  Bank of China 3988, +0.96% BACHY, -3.10% 601988, -0.52%  China Construction Bank 3328, +0.97% BKFCF, -14.29% 601939, -0.41%  and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China 1398, +0.30% IDCBF, -2.35% 601398, -0.34%  . The talks have also hit snags over profit-sharing issues, according to sources. Apple Pay in the U.S. charges 0.15% of the 2% fee paid by merchants for each credit-card payment, as well as a half-cent for each debit-card payment, according to the company. The National Development and Reform Commission, China’s top economic planner, says merchants can be charged between 0.38% and 1.25% for each credit- or debit-card transaction. Currently, 70% of these fees go to the card issuer, 20% to the acquiring bank which processes the card payment and 10% to UnionPay. “Apple Pay’s 0.15% fee charge is too high for China,” said a bank source who asked not to be named. China Merchants Bank, the clientele of which is said to generally include more young adults than other banks, appears more willing than other institutions to cooperate with Apple, the person said. Banks that are bigger than Merchants “have mature POS markets, and they don’t have to relinquish such a large share of their profits just for a payment service that’s in vogue,” said a source at one of China’s biggest state banks. “It won’t give a big bank any significant advantage. How many customers would come get a bank card just for Apple Pay? I wouldn’t expect many.” Alipay charges merchants 0.7% to 1.2% per transaction, while WeChat Wallet charges 0.6%. Smaller players charge less. These payment services “don’t follow the fee standards set by banks, so their pricing varies a lot,” said an employee of a large bank who works in the electronic-banking department. “But in general it’s quite low.” Rewritten by Han Wei See this report at Caixin Online.

TCEHY	BEIJING (Caixin Online) — The central bank has given eight private companies six months to prepare for launching a business based on credit information from individuals and companies, the regulator said on Jan. 5.  ABOUT CAIXIN Caixin is a Beijing-based media group dedicated to providing high-quality and authoritative financial and business news and information through periodicals, online and TV/video programs. • Get the Caixin e-newsletter They include the subsidiaries of Ping An Insurance Group Co. 2318, +1.57% PNGAY, -3.31% 601318, +2.04%  and Internet giants Tencent Holdings Ltd. 0700, +1.38% TCEHY, -2.58%  and Ant Financial Services Group, which is related to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, -2.93%  and also controlled by Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma. The permission does not guarantee that all of those companies will get a license, a source from Ant said. This was confirmed by a source close to the central bank. This is the first time the central bank has announced the names of candidates that are likely to be the first running commercial operations based on the gathering and analysis of individual and business credit data. The central government permitted private enterprises to do so in 2013 to diversify services in the field, which have relied overwhelmingly on the central band and are largely limited to basic inquiries about borrower credit history. Companies like Tencent and Ant have said they could do more. Wu Dan, a senior director of Tencent’s payment operations, said last year that the company could offer a new perspective on how likely people are to default on loans, using data that flows through online gaming centers and social networking software. A big portion of the data, which covers more than 800 million users, comes from people who have no credit history with the central bank, and Tencent can help with their credit ratings, he said. Likewise, Sesame Credit Management Co., a subsidiary of Ant, has said it can provide credit ratings for people and companies that use Alibaba’s services and lend to them quickly based on those ratings. It has access to the data of more than 300 million individuals and 37 million small and medium-sized enterprises. Yu Wujie, a chief credit-data analyst at Ant, said Sesame processes an amount of data every day that is 5,000 times the size of the national library’s digital records. It covers a wide range of fields, including online-shopping habits and how people pay their bills, he said. One issue that remains unclear is how these companies can run businesses without violating a central bank requirement that says a credit-data company must collect the information it needs from third parties and sell its products to other firms. This is to prevent conflicts of interest that might arise when firms gather data from their own customers and use it for profit, a central bank official said previously. Critics have also questioned the legitimacy of Ping An engaging in the business. The law prohibits banks from making such investments, but it does not say whether the holding company of a bank, like Ping An, which owns Ping An Bank, should follow the same requirement. Qiu Han, a Ping An executive in charge of its big-data operations, said a firewall will stand between its credit data unit and other parts of its operations.

TCEHY	Bloomberg Chinese Internet giant Baidu Inc. will invest in ride-hailing app Uber Technologies Inc., a person familiar with the matter said Friday, in a move that could help the U.S. startup’s business in China. Details of the investment amount weren’t immediately known. Baidu said it plans to announce an investment in a U.S. startup on Dec. 17, but didn’t provide further details. The Baidu investment will give the San Francisco-based company a strong partner in a market that it entered last year but hasn’t gained much traction in due to stronger local competitors. Baidu BIDU, -2.55%  competes with Internet giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, -2.93% which has an investment in taxi-hailing app Kuadi Dache. Tencent Holding Ltd. TCEHY, -2.58%  also has an investment in cab-booking app Didi Dache, which said Tuesday it raised more than $700 million in its latest funding round led by Singapore state investment firm Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. For Baidu, the deal could allow China’s dominant search engine to expand its mobile Internet offerings to attract more users. Baidu has a popular map application that could be able to offer users the ability to book Uber rides. Earlier this month, Uber raised $1.2 billion in a new round of funding that valued the company at $41 billion.

TCEHY	Everett Collection HBO show Girls. HONG KONG — Time Warner Inc.’s HBO has signed a deal with Tencent Holdings Ltd. to distribute its TV dramas and movies through the Chinese Internet giant’s online video site as the U.S. cable network tries to expand its audience in the world’s most populous country. For the network behind popular series such as “Game of Thrones” and “True Detective,” the partnership could allow it to take advantage of Tencent’s massive online user base and create an official distribution channel in a market where pirated videos are rampant. For Tencent 0700, +1.38% TCEHY, -2.58%  , whose online games and social networks have hundreds of millions of users in China, the deal with HBO TWX, -0.90%   is part of its attempt to move ahead of rivals in online entertainment, a major battlefield for China’s technology firms. In July, e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, -2.93%  announced an alliance with Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. to offer the U.S. firm’s programs on the Chinese firm’s set-top boxes. Xiaomi Inc., China’s largest smartphone maker by shipments, said earlier this month that it will invest $1 billion to acquire TV programs. Under the deal, Tencent Video, the Chinese company’s video site, becomes the exclusive online platform for HBO shows in China, the companies said in a statement Tuesday. Tencent Video, a major video site available on PCs, tablets and smartphones, competes against Youku Tudou Inc., in which Alibaba holds a 16.5% stake. Financial terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.

TCEHY	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) — With Uber battered from several PR black eyes in the past week, its rivals around the world are undoubtedly drooling at the opportunity to steal some of the company’s thunder. CB Insights CEO Anand Sanwal said he doesn’t think Uber will lose much funding steam despite facing backlash this week following an executive’s comments that he has no problem snooping on problematic journalists. But with the media aflutter and some customers cancelling their Uber accounts, you just might be looking for an alternative to Uber this weekend. Depending on where you live, try some of these: United States Lyft — Based in the U.S., and known for its trademark pink mustache, Lyft is Uber’s chief rival. The company has raised $332.5 million so far, giving the company a value of $700 million in the most recent funding round, according to CB Insights. Uber is still much larger, having raised a whopping $1.5 billion, giving it a valuation of $18.2 billion. Lyft’s biggest backers are Mayfield Fund, Founders Fund, Andreessen Horowitz and Coatue Management. The company has been quiet on the Uber debacle so far, and did not immediately respond to MarketWatch for comment. But the two companies have long jabbed at each other. SideCar — SideCar is the third-biggest ride-sharing company in the U.S. behind Uber and Lyft. It has raised $36.3 million, mostly from Lightspeed Venture Partners, Google Ventures, Union Square Ventures and SV Angel. Since SideCar offers a competitive marketplace that lets drivers set their own prices, its prices are typically more competitive than its larger rivals. Flywheel Software — Flywheel has raised $35.8 million, with the latest round of $12 million announced on Thursday. The company works a little differently than Lyft and Uber in that it functions more like a marketplace, connecting cab hailers to taxi fleets and taking a flat 10% cut for every fare booked through its app. In an interview with GeekWire earlier this week, the company said its technology is now offered in 80% of San Francisco taxis. The app is also available in Seattle and Los Angeles. Flywheel’s chief executive, Rakesh Marthur, said in the GeekWire interview that he believes Flywheel could scale bigger than Uber. Other U.S. companies offering similar services in the U.S. are Alexandria, Va.-based Ridecharge, parent of the taxi-sharing app Curb, which has raised $20.7 million; New York City-based Via Transportation, which has raised $10.1 million; and San Francisco-based Summon, whose funding is not publicly disclosed, according to CB Insights.

TCEHY	"Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com Inc. JD, -2.39% swung to a third-quarter loss due to expenses from a tie-up with mobile messaging giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. (0700.HK) and other costs, as its expands to try to narrow the gap with market leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.(BABA) JD.com said its net loss for the three months ended Sept. 30 was CNY164.4 million ($26.8 million), from a net profit of CNY75 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 61% to 29 billion. It forecast fourth-quarter revenue of between CNY32 billion and CNY33 billion, or annual growth of 59% to 64%. The company said excluding one-off expenses related to the amortization of assets from its partnership with Tencent, earnings rose to CNY370.8 million from CNY141.2 million a year earlier. Gross merchandise volume or the amount of transactions on its site -- a key metric to measure the performance of e-commerce companies -- more than doubled in the quarter to CNY67.3 billion, the company said. JD.com said expenses for marketing, technology, content, and general costs all more than doubled as the company expanded its infrastructure. ""Looking ahead, we will focus on ... expanding the range of products and services available on our platform, optimizing our mobile offerings and penetrating into fast growing lower-tier cities,"" said Richard Liu, JD.com chairman and chief executive, in a statement. JD.com and Alibaba are China's largest e-commerce players, but have different business models. JD.com, like Amazon.com Inc., is an online retailer that mainly procures and sells products directly to consumers. Alibaba, by contrast, operates marketplaces where many merchants can sell their own products. Both companies listed in the U.S. this year, with high investor interest in China's booming e-commerce industry. JD.com's key advantage over Alibaba is its faster average delivery time with its own warehouses, said Jefferies analyst Cynthia Meng. She said 80% of JD.com's orders in major Chinese cities can be fulfilled on the same day or the next, a higher percentage than Alibaba. But Alibaba has advantages of scale and offerings, with many more times the number of items in its online bazaars than JD.com. In September, China's mobile messaging and online games leader Tencent struck a deal to join forces with JD.com in their mutual battle against Alibaba, with Tencent agreeing to use its popular chat apps to drive traffic to JD.com. In return, JD.com took over Tencent's e-commerce units, and Tencent acquired a stake in JD.com. In the third quarter, JD.com had 46.1 million active customer accounts, compared with 22.1 million a year earlier, the company said. Juro Osawa contributed to this article.

TCEHY	Chinese Internet firm Sina Corp. posted a decline in third-quarter earnings excluding items as operating expenses increased, but the company said Thursday that its popular Weibo social media platform made progress in revenue and user growth. For the fourth quarter, Sina projects revenue of $204 million to $210 million, excluding $2.6 million of deferred license revenue, while analysts polled by Thomson Reuters forecast $215 million. Sina was an early pioneer of the Chinese Internet, providing web portals, news aggregation and fee-based information services. But the company has been overshadowed by such other giants as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., and is now diversifying into such areas as online financial services. The Twitter-like Weibo service partnered with Alibaba at the beginning of the year to launch Weibo Payment to compete with Tencent's widely used WeChat payment services. In April, the Chinese government revoked two Sina online-publication and distribution licenses, citing concerns over lewd content. For the period ended Sept. 30, net income was $133.6 million, or $1.91 a share, up from $25.4 million, or 37 cents a share, a year earlier. Results in the latest quarter including a $109.2 million gain related to the sale of part of the company's investment in Alibaba, and other items. Earnings excluding items fell to $13.1 million, or 19 cents a share, down from $28.5 million, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings of 17 cents a share. Revenue rose 8% to $198.6 million. Non-GAAP revenue was $196 million, compared with the company's projection of $193 million to $199 million. Operating expenses rose to $135.7 million from $94.9 million, reflecting higher personnel and marketing costs and bad-debt expenses. Weibo's monthly active users at Sept. 30 rose 36% from a year ago to 167 million. Weibo Corp. became a separate public company in April. In its own earnings statement, the company said revenue increased 58% to $84.1 million, above the company's guidance of $79 million to $82 million. It expects fourth-quarter revenue of $102 million to $105 million. Weibo posted a loss of $5.2 million, or three cents a share, compared with a loss of $5.3 million, or four cents a share, a year earlier. Its loss excluding items was one cent a share.

TCEHY	"HONG KONG--Chinese Internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. said its third-quarter net profit rose 46% from a year earlier, boosted by strong revenue growth from online games and advertising. The Hong Kong-listed company's net profit for the three months ended Sept. 30 rose to 5.68 billion yuan (US$927 million) from 3.87 billion yuan a year earlier, but missed analysts' estimates for profit growth of 57%. Revenue rose 28% to 19.8 billion yuan, also missing analysts' expectations. Tencent's online games business continued to be a key driver of revenue growth for the Shenzhen-based conglomerate, which dominates the sector. Tencent said online games revenue grew 34% to 11.3 billion yuan from a year earlier in the quarter, but was flat from the second quarter. Online advertising revenue grew 76%. Though Tencent has maintained dominance over online PC games, its leadership in mobile games faces more challenges, ""Tencent's position in the mobile-games sector is leading, but there are a lot of upcoming competitors that are trying to shake its position,"" said Chenyu Cui, an analyst at IHS Technology. Tencent said revenue from smartphone games integrated with its mobile messaging platforms fell to 2.6 billion yuan from about three billion yuan in the second quarter due to delayed upgrades. Leading up to Tencent's earnings, investors and analysts had expressed concerns about a slowdown in its mobile-games business, seen as a key to growth as the number of people in China who access the Internet on mobile phones and tablets exceeds those who use the Internet on desktop computers. Analysts say Tencent's competitive advantage is in its hugely popular social-media mobile platforms WeChat and QQ, which the company uses to channel users to its mobile games. Tencent executives had told investors in last quarter's earnings call that they were expecting only stable growth in mobile-games revenue for the second half of the year because the company wanted to focus on improving the user experience, attracting more third-party games and developing more games in-house. The outlook prompted J.P. Morgan's analysts to cut their estimate of Tencent's smartphone game revenue to 2.5 billion yuan for the quarter from 3.7 billion yuan in September. The mobile online-games sector in general is pressured by slowing growth in the shipment of smartphones in China, Ms. Cui said. Also, the life cycle of mobile games appears to be much shorter than that of PC games, the best of which can remain popular for a decade. ""It looks like Tencent needs to roll out a lot of games quarter over quarter to keep users addicted to Tencent's mobile games,"" Ms. Cui said. Tencent's social-messaging platforms, Weixin, WeChat and QQ, enjoy a virtual monopoly in China, and growth in the company's social-networking sites' user bases is watched closely. In the third quarter, the company said there were 819 million monthly active users of QQ and 468 million users of Weixin and WeChat, which rivals WhatsApp. Access Investor Kit for Tencent Holdings Ltd.

TCEHY	HONG KONG -- Chinese Internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. said its third-quarter net profit rose 46% from a year earlier, boosted by strong revenue growth from online games and advertising. The Hong Kong-listed, Shenzhen-based company's net profit for the three months ended Sept. 30 rose to 5.68 billion yuan (US$927 million) from 3.87 billion yuan a year earlier, but missed analysts' forecasts for a net profit increase of 57% to 6.14 billion yuan. Revenue rose to 19.8 billion yuan from 15.5 billion yuan, missing analysts' estimates of 20.5 billion yuan, according to a survey by FactSet. But its revenue surpassed the $2.74 billion in revenue reported by rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. in the same quarter. Alibaba raised $25 billion in the world's biggest initial public offering this year. Still, Tencent's growth came despite concerns about a slowdown in its mobile-games business, which has been a key growth driver for the company over the past year as the number of people in China who access the Internet on smartphones and tablets exceeded those who did so on desktop computers. Analysts say Tencent's key competitive advantage is its hugely popular social-media messaging platforms WeChat and QQ, which the company has used to channel users to its mobile games.

TCEHY	"Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., in its first earnings report as a listed company, said its quarterly earnings plunged after it handed out stock awards to employees and executives but stressed that its e-commerce operations are still growing strongly. The Chinese e-commerce giant said Tuesday that net profit for the quarter ended in September fell 39% to $494 million, or 20 cents a share. The company said the decline came from ""share-based compensation"" it gave out before its record $25 billion initial public offering, in an attempt to hold staff and reward them for good performance. Outside of that one-time expense, however, Alibaba's earnings growth was robust. Revenue for the quarter rose 54% to $2.74 billion, as online shopping transactions continued to grow, and its mobile services generated more revenue. Investors are counting on Alibaba's robust growth in the coming years as China's e-commerce market expands into small cities and rural areas. Hangzhou-based Alibaba, which operates Taobao and Tmall marketplaces, accounts for about 80% of China's online transactions, according to analysts. Merchants on Taobao and Tmall did a combined $90.5 billion worth of business in the quarter through September, up 49% from a year earlier, Alibaba said. Taobao, which hosts millions of small merchants, accounted for about two-thirds that total, while Tmall, where major global brands like Apple Inc. and Nike Inc. set up shop, accounted for the rest. The results also showed that more of Alibaba's e-commerce transactions are coming through smartphones and tablets. Mobile transactions accounted for 35.8% of the overall transactions on Taobao and Tmall in the quarter through September, up from 14.7% a year earlier. The number of active users on Alibaba's mobile platforms increased to 217 million in September from 188 million in June. The increase in mobile users and transactions shows Alibaba is quickly adapting to an environment in which more Chinese consumers access online services through smartphones. Yet that shift to mobile commerce has also weighed on earnings. That's because the bulk of Alibaba's revenue--a little more than half during the business year ended March--came from advertising and marketing services such as those it offers to merchants on Taobao. And Taobao vendors pay Alibaba less for mobile advertising than on personal computers, the company has said. But the latest quarterly results showed improvements in Alibaba's mobile monetization rate, or the amount of revenue it earns per transaction on a mobile device. The rate rose to 1.87% in the September quarter from 1.49% the previous quarter. That is still below the desktop rate of 2.54%, but the gap has been narrrowing. Another challenge facing Alibaba is intensifying competition from its chief Chinese Internet rival, Tencent Holdings Ltd., which dominates online games and mobile messaging, and is expanding into e-commerce. Tencent is integrating e-commerce services into its popular messaging app WeChat, which has over 400 million active users mainly in China. Excluding certain costs, such as those related to the initial public offering, Alibaba had earnings of 45 cents a share for the September quarter, in line with the average analyst estimate on Thomson Reuters. The company's revenue surpassed the average estimate of $2.61 billion. Shares of the Chinese e-commerce giant, which have risen about 50% since its record $25 billion debut on the New York Stock Exchange in September, initially rose in premarket trading following the results but more recently slipped more than 1%. A libaba said that on its China retail marketplaces, gross merchandise volume for the quarter increased 49% and annual active buyers increased 52% year-over-year.

TCEHY	HONG KONG-- China Mobile Ltd.'s nine-month net profit fell 9.7%, weighed down by stiff competition and the carrier's increased investments in its network. The world's largest mobile carrier by subscribers has been hit by the government's continued efforts to reform state-controlled companies by promoting competition. Being the dominant player in China, China Mobile was ordered to reduce the interconnection fees--money it receives from smaller domestic rivals to connect to its network--beginning this year. China Mobile started offering Apple Inc.'s iPhones in January, giving the U.S. technology firm access to more than 700 million mobile users in China. Investors had raised concerns over the impact of the hefty handset subsidy, but China Mobile said in August that it would cut this year's handset subsidies to 21 billion yuan ($3.4 billion) from 34 billion yuan it planned earlier this year as part of the mobile giant's latest effort to improve its profitability. To fend off rising competition in China, the company is doubling its capital spending to $12 billion this year to upgrade its network to provide speedier fourth-generation mobile services. China Mobile is hoping its head start in building a faster 4G network capable of handling data-heavy applications such as video streaming and mobile games could help the company regain growth momentum. China Mobile's net profit for the nine months ended September 30 fell to 82.60 billion yuan ($13.48 billion) from 91.50 billion yuan a year earlier. Revenue rose 3.9% to 481.24 billion yuan from 463.01 billion yuan a year ago The company didn't provide a figure for the third quarter. Based on first-half net profit of 57.74 billion yuan, China Mobile's third-quarter figure would be 24.86 billion yuan, down from 28.40 billion yuan a year earlier. Chinese Internet company Tencent Holdings Ltd.'s popular instant communication application WeChat, which allows users to send free voice and text messages, was also a drain on the company's revenue from texting. To mitigate the loss in revenue, China Mobile has been striving to grow its new data and multimedia content services. With more than 790 million mobile subscribers, China Mobile controls more than 50% of the world's largest mobile market by subscribers. But the company's results contrast with smaller rival China Unicom, which is expected to report an increase in its nine-month earnings later this week. Analysts said the costly network investments will continue to weigh on the company's earnings this year but China Mobile could see better growth next year as its 4G network coverage is expected to boost its data revenue and help lure more customers from rivals.

TCEHY	Bloomberg /file 2012 A Sinopec gas station in Hong Kong. HONG KONG—China’ s largest oil refiner said Sunday it will sell almost a 30% stake in its sales-and-marketing unit for 107.094 billion yuan ($17.44 billion) to 25 investors as part of Beijing’s efforts to inject private capital into state-owned enterprises to boost returns and efficiency. China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., known as Sinopec, SHI, +0.50% said it would retain a 70.01% stake in the unit, known as Sinopec Sales, which operates more than 30,000 gasoline stations and 23,000 convenience stores in some of the richest areas of China. No investor will own more than a 2.8% stake in the unit. The investors run the gamut of industries—life insurance, technology, appliance making and juice production, among others—and include a number of companies that already have been announced as Sinopec’ s “strategic partners.” One investor is a fund that counts Chinese Internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY, -2.58%  among its shareholders. More than half of Sinopec’s 25 newest investors are incorporated in China, with the other half incorporated offshore but ultimately related to Chinese entities. Earlier this year, Sinopec Chairman Fu Chengyu said the stake would be open to both foreign and domestic investors. The announcement caps a process that began in February, when Sinopec said it was following directives laid out in China’s landmark reform blueprint issued in November, which called for private companies to play a larger role in a mixed-ownership economy. Sinopec has the largest petroleum sales-and-distribution network in China, based on the number of its fuel stations, which the company pegs at 30,532 at the end of last year. The associated convenience-store network is the biggest in the country, with a footprint 12 times as large as 7-Eleven’s, according to brokerage firm Bernstein Research.

TCEHY	It’s the $24 billion question on Wall Street: Will Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s huge initial public offering be a bargain for investors? With about a week to go before the deal, the army of banks hired by the Chinese e-commerce company is trying to convince fund managers that its shares are cheap given Alibaba’s growth potential and future profits. Their pitch: Alibaba could start life as a public company at a valuation that is about 24 times its projected 2015 earnings, people familiar with the conversations said. That is below the 29 times currently commanded by Chinese Internet rival Tencent Holdings Ltd. 0700, +1.38% TCEHY, -2.58% The discount is bigger when Alibaba is compared with the valuation of more than 35 times for Facebook Inc. FB, -1.34% the largest technology company to stage an IPO in recent years. The potential pricing gap matters because many investors expect Alibaba, which operates online marketplaces and sells services to businesses that use the markets, to command a valuation on par with those companies once it begins trading. As a result, those who buy early could be sitting on a nice profit within days of the IPO, which could raise more than $24 billion. But the math isn’t straightforward. It’s based on the banks’ own analysts’ forecasts for Alibaba’s earnings growth. And Alibaba can still decide to boost the price of shares sold in its IPO, increasing its valuation. What’s more, at the valuation currently being discussed, Alibaba would be more expensive than more-established and better-known companies such as Google Inc. or eBay Inc.

TCEHY	Bloomberg HONG KONG — As Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. kicks off a U.S. initial public offering that could raise as much as $24 billion, the Chinese e-commerce company is charging into new areas to keep its growth momentum strong. Alibaba’s latest venture is in mobile games, where in recent months the company has bought a stake in a U.S. mobile-game publisher, teamed up with Chinese and foreign game developers and aggressively hired staff in China as well as other countries such as South Korea. Alibaba is going into mobile games to boost revenue and stay ahead in China’s fiercely competitive Internet market, where its chief rival, Tencent Holdings Ltd. 0700, +1.38% TCEHY, -2.58% has a leading position in online games. In its battle to win over consumers, Alibaba is offering mobile games to keep smartphone users engaged even when they aren’t shopping on its e-commerce sites. For Alibaba and other Chinese Internet companies, the growing popularity of mobile games makes the market too attractive to ignore. China already has more than 350 million mobile gamers — more than those in the U.S. and Japan combined, according to research firm Newzoo. The firm expects China’s mobile-game revenue to nearly triple to $6.6 billion in 2016 from $2.28 billion last year, overtaking the U.S. and Japan as the world’s largest market. Newzoo projects U.S. revenue in 2016 to reach $6.4 billion and Japan revenue to hit $6.1 billion. Alibaba only started offering games through its Mobile Taobao shopping app and Laiwang messaging app in January. But even latecomers have opportunities to build sizable businesses, as the market is still developing, says Vincent Cheuk, a China technology partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers. Alibaba doesn’t disclose its revenue from mobile games. More than 95% of its total revenue of about $2.5 billion in the second quarter came from its e-commerce businesses. By comparison, rival Tencent, whose main businesses are games and social networks, derived the majority of its $3.2 billion in second-quarter revenue from games played on personal computers and mobile devices.

TCEHY	Alibaba Alibaba founder and Chairman Jack Ma HONG KONG (MarketWatch) — As Alibaba kicks-off its IPO roadshow, Chairman Jack Ma has written to potential investors asking for patience: They would be third on his priority list behind customers and even employees. Fourth would be more accurate, as mainland China’s new richest man forgot to include himself. If you examine Ma’s track record of shifting assets between public markets and private holdings, earlier minority shareholders missed out on the tremendous wealth created by this Chinese e-commerce juggernaut. This was made possible by borrowing the age-old trick of Asian godfather tycoons: sell high to the public and buy back low. Only the most brazen then try to sell back a second time. While Alibaba might need a letter of introduction to U.S. investors, it needs none in Hong Kong. The group had a previous listing in the territory through its original business-to-business e-commerce portal Alibaba.com seven years earlier. This might come as a surprise, however, if you read Alibaba’s corporate-history milestones in its latest filings. Its Hong Kong listing — timed within a week of the Hang Seng Index HSI, +1.28%  reaching a record high and billed at the time as the biggest tech IPO since Google GOOG, -2.02% GOOGL, -2.20%  — does even not merit a mention. Perhaps this is because it was a curiously unsuccessful period in Alibaba’s otherwise meteoric rise. A year after its market debut, Alibaba.com shares had lost 55% in value. There was little improvement after a series of disappointing financial results and a trading scandal. In the end, the company was delisted in 2012, with shareholders at least getting their money back as the privatization matched the IPO price. For these investors, Ma’s message to wait in line so that management can create long-term shareholder value, will have a distinctly hollow ring as Alibaba magically reappears. More so, the IPO — potentially the world’s biggest ever share offering at up to $24.3 billion — will also catapult Jack Ma higher atop China’s rich list. Only earlier investors, Japan’s Softbank 9984, -0.50% SFTBF, -2.81%  and America’s Yahoo US:YHOO  which own 34.1% and 22.4% of Alibaba, respectively, can be happy. To illustrate how investors who bought into China’s leading e-commerce company in 2007 got a raw deal, let’s compare Alibaba.com to the two other giants of the Chinese internet world, Baidu BIDU, -2.55%  and Tencent 0700, +1.43% TCEHY, -2.58% The founders of Tencent (Pony Ma) and Baidu (Robin Li) are just behind Ma on mainland China’s rich list, with net worths of $16.6 billion and $16.3 billion, respectively, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. Jack Ma now sits top of the pile with a net worth of $21.9 billion. The striking difference, however, is that IPO investors in Baidu and Tencent also got rich alongside the founding shareholders. Tencent earned profits of 2.5 billion Hong Kong dollars ($323 million) in 2013, while its share price has risen from the HK$12 mark in 2008 to over HK$120. U.S.-listed Baidu’s share price has done even better, rising from a $12 level in 2009 to $226 as its net profit reached $1.7 billion in 2013. This happened because both Tencent and Baidu used their publicly-listed entities as the main vehicle for expansion, meaning the interests of minority shareholders and insiders were aligned. It was a different story with Alibaba.com, despite being China’s leading e-commerce company at a time of tremendous market growth. As the e-commerce market developed, Alibaba sliced and diced its business between private and public. For those investors who funded Alibaba.com to the tune of $1.5 billion in its IPO, they would only hear of exciting new growth in businesses Ma was developing — such as online auction site Taobao or electronic-payment site Alipay — yet they were kept outside the listed entity. Now Alibaba is coming back to the market within two years of its earlier delisting and no longer has any problem making its numbers. In its latest quarterly filing, Alibaba reported net profit was $2 billion after nearly tripling year-on-year. You might say this is all just bad luck — Alibaba does have a great business and fresh start. But history could still repeat itself. For one, Ma has again timed his listing with record highs for the equity markets. Secondly, the issue of misaligned interests between private and public businesses again looms large. Alibaba is only listing in the U.S. because Hong Kong would not agree to waive its one-share-one-vote rule. Alibaba insists on a complicated partnership structure that allows the management board to keep control with a minority stake. This is significant because almost half Ma’s fortune is tied up in Alipay — which is technically not included in the listing — where he personally owns 48.5%, according to Bloomberg, dwarfing his 8% stake in Alibaba. IPO investors must hope this time Jack Ma does not again see the IPO as the finishing line, only afterward switching to a vehicle where he has more to gain.

TCEHY	idreamsky NEW YORK (MarketWatch) — Shares of mobile game distributor iDreamSky Technology Ltd. climbed Tuesday after a mandated post-IPO quiet period expired and investors braced for a wave of bullish analyst notes from the company’s underwriters. The 25-day quiet period ended Aug. 31, enabling iDreamSky’s US:DSKY  lead underwriters Credit Suisse Group CS, -2.00%  , J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -2.49%  , Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. SF, -2.86%   and Piper Jaffray Cos. PJC, -7.23%  to speak out about the company for the first time. Stifel analyst George Askew initiated coverage on iDreamSky Tuesday with a buy rating and a $27 price target, calling the mobile games distributor an “emerging force in China mobile games.” “We believe the company is very well positioned to take advantage of the emerging mobile games industry in China which is projected to more than triple in size from $2.2 billion in 2013 to a projected $6.9 billion in 2016, a three-year CAGR of 46%,” Askew said. Among the competitive advantages identified by Askew are iDreamSky’s own proprietary distribution platform that generated 23.8 million game downloads and activations in the first quarter, representing 32.2% of the company’s total. iDreamSky is 23.1% owned by Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY, -2.58% 0700, +1.43% China’s leading mobile-game company, which has helped foster strong relationships with developers, Askew said. Elsewhere, Piper Jiffray initiated coverage on iDreamSky with an overweight rating. The company’s stock priced at $15 on Aug. 6, above its expected price range, and gained as much as 27% on its first day of trade. The China-based distributor of popular mobile games such as “Fruit Ninja” and “Temple Run” raised $115.5 million through the offering of 7.7 million shares. Shares are jumped 40% since then, including a 3% gain to $21.20 in premarket trade on Tuesday. That has sharply outpaced the broader S&P 500, which has gained 4% over the last 30 days.

TCEHY	HONG KONG (MarketWatch) — China recently launched a dragnet to combat drug use, including the arrest of six major movie and TV stars over the past six months, but at least one entertainment-industry insider says the busts are actually about cutthroat competition among the studios, reports said Friday. In addition to the high-profile arrests of Jaycee Chan, actor and son of action star Jackie Chan, and Taiwanese star Kai Ko for the possession of more than 100 grams of marijuana, the law-enforcement campaign has pulled in four other noted actors, along with a director, a singer and a screenwriter. But while police say the string of arrests is simply aimed at stamping out drug abuse, several media reports said the unusual spike in the apprehension of celebrities may be due to competing film and TV production companies targeting each others’ stars with anonymous tip-offs. Cao Haitao, a venture-capital investor in China’s entertainment sector, noted “the recent M&A craze in the movie and TV industry“ had increased the stakes for companies, some of which “may be weeded out through competitive selection,” according to a report Friday in the Securities Daily newspaper. The effect of a key star going to prison can be poison for some companies. For instance, Ko’s movie-production company is probably suffering heavily from his arrest, as Ko was scheduled to perform in three films currently in production, including the latest installment of summer blockbuster “Tiny Times 4,” the report cited an unnamed source as saying. And in fact, Beijing’s police department said on its official Weibo microblogging account that Chan and Ko were caught thanks to an anonymous informant. But some businesses are seeking to profit from the arrests — LN.QQ.com, a web site co-owned by Tencent Holdings Ltd. 0700, +1.48% TCEHY, -2.58%  and the state-run Liaoning Media Group, now features an online game capitalizing on the arrests of Chan and Ko. The game is called “Daliao Rush Hour: Everyone looks for Fang Zuming,” referring to Jaycee Chan’s Chinese name. “It’s more like entertainment marketing to promote and drive traffic for the website.,” Xue Yongfeng, a game industry analyst for Analysys International, told the Securities Daily of the game.

TCEHY	"HONG KONG--Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.'s discovery of potential accounting irregularities at the film-production arm it recently bought is the latest red flag for investors as the e-commerce giant prepares for what could be the largest initial public offering in U.S. history. The disclosure Friday that Alibaba Pictures would delay its financial results while it investigated what it called ""possibly noncompliant"" accounting practices, won't likely derail the Internet company's IPO plans, investors and analysts said. But it is a black eye for Alibaba Group at a time when it is aggressively courting investors. Bankers say Alibaba's IPO, which people familiar with the matter say could come as early as September, could raise more than $20 billion. While the accounting issues are believed to have occurred before Alibaba bought the film production company--then called ChinaVision Media Group Ltd.--for more than $800 million in June, they raise questions about whether the Internet giant rushed into the deal. ""This makes you wonder whether there was enough due diligence in Alibaba's decision to buy ChinaVision, "" said Tony Chu, analyst for an RS Investments fund that is considering whether to buy Alibaba's shares. As Alibaba, China's largest e-commerce company, juggles a massive IPO with many acquisitions, ""it's possible that its management resources are being stretched,"" Mr. Chu said. Alibaba Group, in a statement, said that it ""fully supports the new management of Alibaba Pictures as they thoroughly review and rectify the possible financial noncompliance they have found with the former ChinaVision."" Alibaba changed ChinaVision's name to Alibaba Pictures Group after the acquisition. Goldman Sachs, which advised Alibaba on the ChinaVision deal, declined to comment. Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, ChinaVision's longtime auditor, said in a statement that ""confidentiality duties prevent us from discussing matters related to our clients with third parties."" Analysts say that, unless the accounting problems widen, they aren't likely to affect investors' appetite. The film business is small compared with the company's mainstay e-commerce operations, so even if the investigation results in write-offs of assets or project delays at Alibaba Pictures, that won't have a significant impact on Alibaba Group's revenue or profit, said Forrester Research's Bryan Wang. Still, some say the accounting problems could point to larger issues. As Alibaba keeps buying more companies in China, there is a risk that some of those companies have lower standards in terms of management and accounting, said a China-based fund manager, who declined to be named. Alibaba Group has made more than a dozen acquisitions this year as it tries to capture the next boom market in Chinese consumption online and compete against other Internet companies such as Tencent Holdings Ltd., which are also expanding quickly. These acquisitions include paying more than $1 billion for a 16.5% stake in Youku Tudou, an online video-site operator, to $194 million for a 50% stake in the Guangzhou Evergrande Football Club, a professional soccer team. For some investors, the bigger question is whether Alibaba's high operating margin--45.3% in the quarter though March--is sustainable in the long run when the company is under pressure to spend more on new services, marketing and acquisitions as it tries to get ahead of rivals. David Webb, an investor advocate in Hong Kong, said the accounting problems ""are a sideshow to the real issues"" of governance and the rights of minority shareholders that may cause investors to stay away from Alibaba or discount the price they would pay for the shares. Mr. Webb has expressed concern about Alibaba's corporate structure, which allows its partners--founder Jack Ma and other executives--to nominate the majority of its board directors, even though they don't own the majority of the company. Potential accounting issues at Alibaba's film-production arm may not affect Alibaba's overall business in the short term, but it could deal a blow to its ambitions in China's fast-growing film and entertainment industry. Alibaba's plans in the entertainment industry range from taking stakes in Chinese film studios and commissioning original material to acquiring the rights to films inside and outside the country, according to people familiar with the matter. While some investors said that Alibaba overpaid for ChinaVision, the Internet giant found the film-production company appealing because of its film library and its potential as a fundraising platform, according to a person familiar with the deal. Since purchasing a 60% stake in ChinaVision, Alibaba has installed a new management team including Zhang Qiang, formerly a top executive with state-controlled China Film Group Corp. Alibaba also replaced Chairman Dong Ping--one of the producers of the Oscar-winning film ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""--with Alibaba's chief risk officer, Shao Xiaofeng, and brought martial-arts and film star Jet Li on as an independent nonexecutive director. Alibaba Pictures said Friday it had requested its stock trading be suspended while it investigates the accounting issues. The film-production company is looking into how far back the potential accounting problems go, and couldn't say whether this issue would affect its previous financial statements, it said in a filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

TCEHY	"HONG KONG-- China Mobile Ltd. posted a 8.5% decline in its first-half net profit Thursday as unfavorable regulatory policies and hefty investment in network upgrades hurt its profitability. The world's largest wireless carrier by subscribers, has been hit by the government's continued efforts to reform state-controlled companies by promoting competition. Being the dominant player in China, China Mobile was ordered to reduce the interconnection fees--money that it receives from smaller domestic rivals to connect to its network--beginning this year. Facing rising competition and a maturing mobile market in China, the company is doubling its capital spending to $12 billion this year to upgrade its network to provide speedier fourth-generation mobile services. China Mobile is hoping its head start in building a faster 4G network capable of handling data-heavy applications such as video streaming and mobile games, could help the company regain growth momentum. China Mobile's net profit for the six months ended June 30 fell to 57.74 billion yuan ($9.37 billion) from 63.13 billion yuan a year earlier. Revenue rose 7.1% to 324.68 billion yuan from 303.10 billion yuan a year ago. Tencent Holdings Ltd.'s popular instant communication application WeChat, which allows users to send free voice and text messages, was also a drain on the company's revenue from texting. To mitigate the loss in revenue, China Mobile has been striving to grow its new data and multimedia content services. The company has also become more active in pursuing growth opportunities beyond its saturated home market. In June, China Mobile agreed to buy an 18% stake in Thai telecommunications carrier True Corp. for $882 million, marking its first significant overseas investment. ""We will look for appropriate external investment opportunities in an active but cautious manner, and strive to broaden our presence in the market to support our transformation and development,"" Chairman Xi Gouhua said in a statement. With more than 790 million mobile subscribers, China Mobile controls more than 50% of the world's largest mobile market by subscribers. But the company's results contrast with a 26% increase in first-half earnings reported by smaller rival China Unicom last week. While the costly network investments will continue to weigh on the company's earnings this year, China Mobile could see better growth next year as its leading 4G network coverage is expected to boost its data revenue and help lure more consumers from rivals, said analysts. ""The network advantage China Mobile is building in 4G will continue to pay dividends for the years ahead. We also believe ( Apple Inc.'s) iPhone 6 will be a major catalyst for subscriber additions,"" said Chris Lane, an analyst at Bernstein Research. China Mobile only started offering iPhones on its new 4G network in January, several years behind China Unicom and China Telecom because it operates on a less popular homegrown 3G technology standard called TD-SCDMA.

TCEHY	"Chinese Internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. posted a 59% jump in second-quarter net profit, as its popular chat app helped drive users to its mobile games and paid services. The operator of China's most widely used mobile instant-messaging service WeChat is on a growth tear, with a second consecutive quarter of profit growth exceeding 50%. Tencent's earnings were bolstered by its large online games business, with mobile games and advertising revenue helping to drive growth. On Wednesday, the Shenzhen-based company said its revenue from social networks increased by 47%, with the number of monthly active WeChat users climbing 57% from a year earlier to 438.2 million. Tencent said its net profit for the three months ended June 30 rose to 5.84 billion yuan ($947 million) from 3.68 billion yuan a year earlier. This beat analysts' expectations of a second-quarter profit of 5.51 billion yuan, according to Thomson One Analytics. Revenue rose 37% to 19.75 billion yuan from 14.38 billion yuan a year earlier, exceeding analyst expectations of 19.20 billion yuan. The strong earnings come despite intensifying rivalry with Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which is preparing for what could be the largest technology initial public offering in history. While the two began in different sectors, they have increasingly clashed directly as they battle for dominance in the world's largest Internet market by users. Tencent's shares fell 0.1% to 133.20 Hong Kong dollars (US$17.18) on Wednesday ahead of the announcement, but its stock has climbed more than 30% since the beginning of the year. The popularity of Tencent's online games and messaging platforms has boosted its market capitalization to $159 billion, compared with Facebook Inc.'s $190 billion, and has made it Asia's most valuable Internet company. But that could change after Alibaba's hotly anticipated IPO, which is slated for this fall. Analysts estimate it could raise more than $20 billion and brokerages have put out valuation estimates of more than $200 billion. Alibaba has moved to chip away at Tencent's mobile dominance in the past year by starting its own instant-messaging service Laiwang. It has also launched mobile games, developed a mobile search service with Beijing-based browser provider UCWeb Inc. and taken a stake in video website Youku Tudou Inc. Meanwhile, Tencent is trying to challenge Alibaba in e-commerce, with a partnership begun in March with China's No. 2 online retailer JD.com and with its own electronic-payment service. A group including Tencent also gained permission from Chinese regulators in July to open a rare private bank, as the company looks to expand its footprint in financial services. Online games remain the company's largest business, however, contributing 56% of revenue in the second quarter. Tencent operates online games including ""Cross Fire"" and ""League of Legends,"" along with games portal QQ Game. Access Investor Kit for Tencent Holdings Ltd.

TCEHY	China for the first time placed restrictions on instant-messaging services — an increasingly popular platform in the country for discussion and debate. Beijing said the restrictions were instituted to “help build a clean cyberspace” and safeguard national security. The rules apply to users with special accounts that let them post messages broadly on chat apps such as Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s 0700, +1.33% TCEHY, -2.58%  WeChat and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s Laiwang. Reuters Such so-called public or official accounts let other users subscribe to message feeds, similar to public pages on Facebook FB, -1.34%  . Businesses and celebrities use the accounts to publicize events and news. Many Chinese bloggers have been migrating to such accounts to spread their views as well, in the wake of a crackdown by the Chinese government last year on other types of social-media platforms. The new rules don’t appear to apply to instant messaging between users and their personal contacts. The rules require new public-account users to register with their real names and sign an agreement that they will “abide by laws and regulations, the socialist system, national interests, the legitimate rights and interests of citizens, public order, social morality and ensure the authenticity of the information they provide.” Khmer Rouge Leaders Get Life Sentences in Cambodia The rules, issued Thursday by China’s State Internet and Information Office, also say that only news organizations and other authorized websites will be allowed to post or share political news through public accounts. Accounts that violate the rules can be warned and restricted from posting content or removed. Tencent said it would take measures against “offensive and abusive activities” to ensure compliance with relevant regulations. Alibaba declined to comment. The restrictions are the latest effort by Beijing to curb the use of social media for public debate and political dissent. China initially let social-media platforms function in a relatively freewheeling manner as a way for the government to monitor opinions and let citizens vent frustrations.

TCEHY	idreamsky NEW YORK (MarketWatch) — The company that distributes the popular “Temple Run 2” and “Subway Surfers” video games in China wants to avoid being cut up in the U.S. stock market like a piece of fruit in one of its popular games. Shares in iDreamSky Technology Ltd. US:DSKY which calls itself the largest independent mobile game publishing platform in China, begin trading Thursday on the Nasdaq. The company doesn’t want to be a replay of “Candy Crush” maker King Digital Entertainment PLC US:KING whose shares tumbled 15.6% on their debut earlier this year. Unlike King, however, iDreamSky, which was founded in 2009, generally doesn’t have its own games. Rather, it works with outside software developers to tweak and then bring those games to China. It boasts of having three of the 10 most popular casual games in the Chinese market during the first quarter as measured by active users, based on a report from Analysys International. “Temple Run 2” ranks second, behind Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s TCEHY, -2.58% 0700, +1.33%  Wechat Platform single-player game series. “Subways Surfers” is ranked third, and “Fruit Ninja” is ninth, ahead of “Candy Crush Saga.” All are free to play. The company makes its most of its money from sales of in-game virtual items such as avatars, skills, privileges and other in-game features. In a sign of strong investor demand, iDreamSky’s 7.7 million American depositary shares were priced at $15 early Thursday, above the indicated range. Still, it’s a relatively modest IPO at $115.5 million, about one-third the size of the $326 million King Digital IPO. Here’s what else to know about iDreamSky: Financials: Revenue climbed to $40.7 million in 2013, from $3.1 million in 2012, and to $28.0 million in the first three months of this year. It swung to a profit of $5.4 million in 2013, from a loss of $1.5 million in 2012. It earned $5.3 million in the first quarter of 2014. (The company disclosed 2012 financials only in yuan.) In 2013, 97.7 million games were downloaded and activated, an 83.4% increase from 2012. First-quarter downloads and activations totaled 23.8 million. Its customers: iDreamSky says it has 98.3 million active monthly users as of March 31 who play on mobile phones as well as other platforms. It currently offers 40 games, according to the IPO prospectus. “Temple Run 2” attracted 30.8 million active users and 10.3 million average daily active users in March, the company said in its prospectus. The games: About 85% of 2013 revenue came from just three games: the “Temple Run” series, “Fruit Ninja” and “Subway Surfers.” Of that, almost half came from the Temple Run series. The share of revenue from those three games fell in the first quarter to 57.2%. iDreamSky said it began publishing two games developed by indirectly owned subsidiaries and a game acquired from another company in the first quarter. Who cashed out: None of the major shareholders are selling shares as part of the IPO. After the share sale and an accompanying private placement, Michael Xiangyu Chen, the company’s 31-year-old chairman and chief executive, will control about 40.1% of the voting power. IPO proceeds: iDreamSky said it will use $60 million raised to buy game licenses and other intellectual property rights related to mobile games. It also will set aside $25 million for acquisitions, according to the prospectus, although it added that it has no near-term commitments for a deal. Risks: The share of game players who pay to play is a tiny percentage of all users — and has fallen. In the first quarter of this year, only 5.2% of active users were paying users, down from the peak of 5.7% recorded in the last three months of 2013. In addition, iDreamSky plans to plan build its own publishing platform that will put it in direct competition with distribution partners. Finally, the company’s auditor can’t be inspected by the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. to assess audit procedures or quality control procedures. In addition, the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2012 brought administrative proceedings against the accounting firm that does iDreamSky’s audit, alleging that it had violated U.S. securities laws and the SEC’s rules and regulations over another matter. In January, the accounting firm was suspended for six months from practicing before the SEC. That case is under appeal. The buzz: iDreamSky should benefit from the relationships and connections it has made with developers and the main storefronts in China, says Lewis Ward, Research director of gaming at IDC. But Apple’s growing success in China could eventually cut into iDreamSky’s business. “If [Apple] continues to do well in China over time, it could erode demand for service that iDreamSky offers today due to its unified ecosystem,” he said. “IOS is doing well; it is selling tens of millions of phones in China.” Read the prospectus here.

TCEHY	HONG KONG (MarketWatch) — As the U.S. stock debut of leading Chinese e-tailer Alibaba Group draws near, China is considering launching its first-ever taxation of the country’s massive e-commerce market, state-run media reported Wednesday. The State Taxation Bureau is carrying out “intensive research” and has set up a special team to study a policy framework on taxing e-commerce, the Economic Information Daily quoted unidentified sources as saying. As part of the move, the government may extend the use of a nationwide “e-invoice” system next year in order to begin collecting data needed to set up a tax regime, the report said. Bloomberg Currently, e-invoices are only used in several regions of China and by a just few online retailers, including JD.com Inc. JD, -2.39%  and Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s 0700, +1.28% TCEHY, -2.58%  Yixun.com. The potential taxation policy might not be good news to China’s emerging online retailers, including the large number which use Alibaba, set to launch its high-profile New York listing. Alibaba declined to comment to MarketWatch for this report, citing the quiet period mandated by its IPO. However, Alibaba founder and chairman Jack Ma has previously expressed acceptance of such a move, saying taxing e-commerce would be only fair. “We support the taxation” of e-commerce, Ma said in an interview with state broadcaster CCTV in November. “I always think, and firmly believe, it’s unethical for companies not to pay taxes.” “The entire society has made a huge contribution to your company, and provided supporting facilities to you.

TCEHY	"While recent China Internet hysteria has been focused on companies like Tencent's WeChat TCEHY, -2.58%  messaging app and Alibaba's upcoming IPO in the U.S., Baidu surprised the market last week by posting strong second-quarter results. With Baidu's investment in mobile paying off more quickly than expected, is it time for investors to get on board with the stock? Baidu BIDU, -2.55% founded in 2000 and has its headquarters in Beijing, is a Chinese Internet-search provider (baidu.com). It is the ""Google"" of China. In 2007, it became the first Chinese company to be included in the Nasdaq-100 index NDX, -2.45% There is still huge growth potential in the Chinese Internet industry due to still-low penetration levels of only 42%. In China, due to government regulation and other considerations, such as knowledge of the language and local culture, Chinese companies dominate. Google GOOG, -2.02%  is not a key player in China, shuttering search in 2010 due to censorship concerns. Baidu has become the leading search provider in the country. Its strong financial position and differentiated search and mobile offerings have positioned it for growth in online advertising. Also, the company has been shifting its focus on extending its search dominance into mobile, with mobile advertising now accounting for 30% of its revenue. Baidu's revenue this quarter was up 59% from a year ago and net profits rose 34%. Baidu currently has a 63% share of the search market, but lost share last year to its Chinese rival Qihoo US:QIHU Despite these market-share losses in Internet search, given its latest financial results, investors can now take comfort in the fact that Baidu has the best smartphone strategy and is the default search engine on most mobile phones. Like Google in the U.S., Baidu has invested in mobile map and location technology and recently acquired a popular Android app store from NetDragon for $1.9 billion. Compared to Quihoo's search engine (so.com), Baidu's mobile search does not just give users links, but also gives local search features, such as location mapping and direct-dial functionality. Baidu's aspirations do not stop at mobile dominance in China. The company announced last May that it would invest $300 million in an R&D center in Silicon Valley which will be headed by ex-Google exec Andrew Ng, a former head of Stanford University's artificial-intelligence lab. There are rumors that the center is developing a bike that could drive itself through packed city streets. More recently, there has been talk of a self-driving car concept. These moves signify that Baidu is not only going after market-share dominance in China, but is ready to go head-to-head with Google in areas beyond search and mobile. Baidu's recent results have renewed investor interest in the stock, which soared to new highs on the recent results. This is a stock I wrote about in my book, Best Stocks Now, in 2011. At the time, I said that I liked Baidu, the ""Google of China,"" better than the Google of America, because there was more upside potential. But let's take a look now. Best Stocks Now analysis Baidu is a $79.4 billion large-cap technology stock that has once again become a Best Stock Now. After falling out of favor and trading flat last year, the stock is roaring back this year on its strong mobile results. The stock does not pay a dividend, so it is not appropriate for income accounts, but it is still an option for conservative or moderate-growth accounts given the size of the company. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Data from Best Stocks Now app My five-year target price on Baidu is $385 per share, so even after its move to $226 per share last week, there is still plenty of room for upside. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

TCEHY	HONG KONG (MarketWatch) -- Alibaba has been in talks with mobile-messaging app provider Snapchat to buy a stake from the three-year-old startup, according to various media reports Wednesday. The deal would value Snapchat as a whole at $10 billion, several reports said, even as The Wall Street Journal put the company's revenue at close to zero. Still, the talks may not lead to a deal, the New York Times quoted unamed sources as saying. Tencent Holdings Ltd. 0700, +1.33% TCEHY, -2.58% one of Alibaba's top rivals, has been an investor in Snapchat since last year, while earlier reporting from AllThingsD named other investors including Institutional Venture Partners, Benchmark Capital and Lightspeed Venture Partners. The messaging service, which let users share photos or videos which erase themselves after several seconds, previously turned down a $3 billion acquisition offers by Facebook Inc.

TCEHY	"BEIJING--Internet conglomerate Tencent Holdings Ltd. will use its alliance with JD.com Inc. to offer early advance sales of Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox One consoles in China, as the online retailer ramps up efforts to compete with electronic-commerce major Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Beijing-based JD.com said Monday that users of Tencent's WeChat and mobile QQ messaging software would be able to reserve the new Xbox with a deposit of 499 yuan ($81), days before the company begins taking preorders from other Chinese consumers on July 31. Microsoft has said the consoles would be delivered in September. JD.com didn't disclose a price for the console. The new Xbox costs up to $500 in the U.S. Until this year, China had banned sales of videogame consoles including Xbox, Sony Corp.'s PlayStation and Nintendo Co.'s Wii over concerns about content. JD.com said it would presell the consoles to users who connect to its retail outlet through Tencent's QQ and WeChat social-media networks. ""Launching Xbox One sales in China through JD.com's Weixin and Mobile QQ entry points underscores the strength of these platforms with young and sophisticated Chinese consumers,"" said Shuang Du, a JD.com vice president. Weixin is the Chinese name of Tencent's WeChat mobile social-media app. The preorders will be available only through the Chinese version of the software. Tencent referred questions to JD.com. A Microsoft spokeswoman said the company would provide more information about the Xbox at a digital entertainment event in Shanghai that starts Thursday. JD.com's use of WeChat offers a glimpse into how Tencent can leverage its sprawling investments to cross-promote its services and pursue the country's more than 500 million smartphone users. Unlike in the U.S., where Internet companies have generally focused on no more than a few core competencies, Chinese companies have long wanted to focus on many areas. Tencent is increasingly competing with China's Alibaba, which is by far the top e-commerce service in China in terms of market share. The latest move came less than five months after Tencent purchased a 15% stake in JD.com, China's second-largest e-commerce player. The two companies also offer a range of competing services from investments to taxi-hailing mobile apps. Alibaba declined to comment. While Alibaba dominates e-commerce in China, Tencent holds a strong presence in QQ, a messaging software that it says has 808 million monthly active users, and WeChat, which it says has 355 million monthly active users world-wide as of the end of last year. China had banned videogame consoles for more than a decade because of concerns about their impact on children. Gray-market machines, however, have long been available at stalls and shops in Chinese computer malls. Even so, the consoles haven't caught on with the country's gamers, who are more accustomed to playing on personal computers. Earlier this year, Microsoft said it would start selling the Xbox One videogame console in China manufactured in a new Shanghai free-trade zone. Corrections & Amplifications Tencent Holdings Ltd.'s WeChat mobile-chat software had 355 million monthly active users world-wide at the end of last year. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said it had 303 million users. Write to Wayne Ma at wayne.ma@wsj.com Write to Wayne Ma at wayne.ma@wsj.com Access Investor Kit for Nintendo Co., Ltd.

TCEHY	Reuters Line Chief Operating Officer Takeshi Idezawa speaks during an event in February. TOKYO — Line Corp., the developer of a fast-growing smartphone messaging application, has applied for an initial public offering on the Tokyo Stock Exchange that could value the company at more than ¥1 trillion ($9.84 billion). A person familiar with the matter said Tuesday that Line, based in Japan but owned by South Korean Internet portal operator Naver Corp., will also likely submit an application for a listing on the New York Stock Exchange and could go public as early as this autumn. While it isn’t clear how large a stake Line intends to sell to the public, the IPO is expected to be one of Japan’s biggest new stock offerings this year. But it will be substantially smaller than the pending listing of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., the Chinese Internet giant that is planning to list in New York in the summer. People familiar with that deal have said Alibaba’s IPO could raise more than $20 billion, valuing the whole company at more than $100 billion. Still, the sale would be sizable by the standards of the Tokyo market, which has had a relative dearth of Internet mega-IPOs since the dot-com boom and bust when companies like Rakuten Inc. 4755, -2.86% RKUNF, +0.00% an e-commerce provider, went public. According to Dealogic, the last listing of an Internet-linked company was Japan’s social-network game operator Gree Inc.’s 3632, +0.34% ¥3.6 billion capital raising in 2008. Line provides free voice calls and messaging and generates revenue from the sale of cutesy emoticons, games and other services. For the first quarter of this year, the company reported sales of ¥14.6 billion, more than triple its sales from a year earlier and up 19% from the fourth quarter. It competes with WhatsApp, which Facebook Inc. FB, -1.34%  this year agreed to buy for $19 billion, and WeChat, which is owned by China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd. 0700, +1.28% TCEHY, -2.58%   Line says it has more than 480 million registered users world-wide. Unlike other popular messaging applications, however, it hasn’t disclosed how many of those users are active monthly, and analysts say that figure is considerably lower than WhatsApp which has more than 500 million monthly active users.

TCEHY	Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is making a major push into entertainment to capture a share of what it thinks will be the next boom market in Chinese consumption online. Although Alibaba has shared only parts of its vision publicly, interviews with roughly two dozen people who have been approached by the company or are familiar with its strategy say that its plans span from taking stakes in Chinese film studios and commissioning original material to acquiring the rights to TV shows or films from inside and outside the country. AMC Actors John Slattery (left) and Jon Hamm in a scene from “Mad Men.” On Tuesday, Alibaba is expected to announce a deal with U.S. production studio Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. US:LGF  to make available on Alibaba set-top boxes offerings such as the “Twilight” hit vampire movie series and the TV show “Mad Men.” The partnership beefs up Alibaba’s entertainment menu as China’s Internet-savvy consumers are increasingly going online to watch TV shows, videos and movies. “Alibaba is a tremendously successful and dominant partner to have in China,” said Jim Packer, Lions Gate’s president of world-wide television and digital distribution. “They touch millions of consumers now.” Mr. Packer said that though Lions Gate has been licensing its movies to Chinese online services for years, this is the first time it will be curating its own selections. Lions Gate and Alibaba aren’t planning any capital tie-ups, said one person familiar with the details of the plan. The entertainment industry is a logical next battleground for Alibaba, whose online shopping sites handled $248 billion of business last year, and which is preparing for a U.S. listing that could be one of the largest in history, analysts say. Alibaba and other Chinese rivals such as Internet giant Tencent 0700, +1.38% TCEHY, -2.58%  are trying to find new avenues to get Chinese consumers to open up their wallets. Alibaba declined to comment. Lilian Lin, Sonja Cheung, Dean Napolitano and Joanne Chiu contributed to this article. An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.

TCEHY	BEIJING (Caixin Online) — E-commerce giant Alibaba Group announced a merger involving mobile Internet browser company UCWeb Inc. last Wednesday. ABOUT CAIXIN Caixin is a Beijing-based media group dedicated to providing high-quality and authoritative financial and business news and information through periodicals, online and TV/video programs. • Get the Caixin e-newsletter Alibaba has set up a department to integrate businesses involving the mobile browser, searches, games, app platform, reader and positioning services. These services are vitally important to the mobile Internet industry. Alibaba has put a lot of effort into mobile service, but can the merger really help it gain a leading position in the industry? UCWeb said the deal settled an important variable for restructuring the mobile Internet industry. The combination of Alibaba’s advantages in e-commerce, cloud computing and big data and UCWeb’s mobile services will bring about big changes, it said, adding: “It is predictable that the balance in mobile Internet service will shift to Alibaba, and the industry will be restructured.” Will the merger be that important? Yu Yongfu, UCWeb’s chairman and the head of department joining the two, did not give an answer when asked last Thursday. When he was asked how UC will help Alibaba to expand its businesses, Yu said the Ali-UC department must first handle its own businesses well. What are UCWeb’s major businesses? Its leading business is mobile browsers. UCWeb started developing the UC Browser in 2004. It says the browser now has more than 500 million users. iResearch Consulting Group says 65.9% of domestic mobile browsers used it. Despite this, the UC Browser is facing a crisis. Mobile browsers by Tencent Holdings 0700, +1.33% TCEHY, -2.58% 0700, +1.33%  and Baidu Inc. BIDU, -2.55%  could reshape the market. Also, many people have turned to integrated services on WeChat, Baidu Map and Alipay, and the number of UC Browser users is falling. Users prefer to use direct functions on apps. They download apps with services that connect to life and work, and use them frequently. UC Browser is usually preinstalled on mobile phones by manufacturers. Some people may not even use it. The only reason it is not uninstalled is that this is hard. This means it is difficult to establish its value. Mobile gaming is another important business for UCWeb. After three years of promotion, its 9game.com platform made its partners 300 million yuan ($48.3 million) in profits last year. The platform has 60 million users every month, and they play about 1,000 online games. Bloomberg Alibaba.com's headquarters in Hangzhou, China. However, its income is not big. Tencent’s mobile game service had revenue of 1.8 billion yuan in the first quarter. The games platforms of China Mobile Games and Entertainment Group Ltd. 0941, +2.38% CHL, +0.31%  , Qihoo 360 US:QIHU  and the mobile operators all have the ability to compete in this field. It seems 9game.com does not have a big share of the market, and its future performance with Alibaba is uncertain. Three other businesses — apps, mobile readers and online searches — are all new businesses for UCWeb. Its Shenma Search service mainly relies on the UCWeb browser. UCWeb said Shenma Search has 20% of the mobile-search market, but industry insiders do not believe this, considering the search offerings of Baidu, Qihoo 360 and Sogou all have brand advantages and tech strengths. As a whole, UCWeb mobile services are not particularly outstanding compared to its competitors. Its browser’s leading position is also disputable, and it has to integrate Alibaba’s new game and search services. The future performance of the Ali-UC merger is uncertain. It is hard to say whether the merger will give Alibaba a dominant role in the mobile Internet market, but it is certain that the deal helps UCWeb because Alibaba has great potential to develop its businesses. Alibaba might see the merger as a way to enter the core businesses of Baidu and Tencent. As the latter two get into online shopping and payment services, Alibaba is fighting back by getting into their areas of focus. UCWeb is a good tool in this fight. What about the importance of UCWeb in Alibaba’s strategy? One way to judge this is with the merger price, but neither party provided this information. UCWeb said the deal was completed through stake-based trading. The companies may think now is not a good time for them to release the price since Alibaba is about to go public in the United States, and indeed this deal could help raise Alibaba’s IPO price.

TCEHY	BEIJING (Caixin Online) — In 2010, Jack Ma, the founder and chairman of Alibaba Group, pledged to none other than former premier Wen Jiabao that he “would not invest a penny into games” because it wasn’t a worthwhile way for the country’s children to spend their time.  ABOUT CAIXIN Caixin is a Beijing-based media group dedicated to providing high-quality and authoritative financial and business news and information through periodicals, online and TV/video programs. • Get the Caixin e-newsletter And yet that is exactly what Alibaba is doing. In January, the e-commerce giant announced it is branching into mobile games, a market that could be worth as much as 50 billion yuan (about $8 billion). And now China’s Big Three Internet companies — Alibaba, Baidu Inc. BIDU, -2.55%   and Tencent Holdings 2988, +1.39% US:TCTZD TCEHY, -2.58%  — are all playing. The director of Alibaba’s mobile-gaming unit is Liu Chunning, who was the vice president in charge of digital entertainment at Tencent before joining Alibaba in September. The goal is nothing short of breaking Tencent’s dominance in online gaming, he said. “We are very unhappy about the dominance of Tencent games,” said Alibaba spokesman Wang Shuai. He said Tencent took about 90% of a game’s profits, leaving their developers little room for growth. (Tencent denies this. Wang Bo, its vice president, said the company takes about 60% or 70%.) Alibaba’s plan is to provide free distribution for developers for a year, and afterward keep 20% of the profits, Liu said. Developers would keep 70%, and the rest would go to charity. Alibaba has been in talks with companies in Japan and South Korea about bringing their popular games to China, a source from Alibaba said. Tencent, however, remains the dominant player. In May 2013, it took steps to make more games available on its different products, especially WeChat and Mobile QQ, an instant messaging app. As of march, Mobile QQ was attracting 500 million players every day and WeChat 355 million. Cao Di — an analyst at iResearch, which studies the country’s Internet sector — said the social nature of WeChat and Mobile QQ made them better game distributors than Taobao Wallet, the app version of Alibaba’s online marketplace and its main game distributor. In addition, Tencent has a large group of users who are in the habit of paying for virtual products, such as songs, virtual decorations for QQ accounts and emoticons, he said. Even though a large number of people have Taobao Wallet, they mostly use it to get physical goods, and Cao said this will affect Alibaba’s ability to profit from mobile games. Bloomberg Tencent is trying for an even higher score in the industry. Mobile games account for 80% of all the contracts it has signed with game developers this year, said Cheng Wu, vice president of interactive entertainment at the company. (The company also sells PC-based games.) And in March, it bought a 28% stake in CJ Game, a subsidiary of South Korea’s CJ E&M Pictures 130960, -0.86%  , for $500 million. Search engine giant Baidu is the other major player in the industry. Last year, it paid $1.9 billion for 91 Wireless, one of the country’s most popular app stores, giving it a substantial game distributor on the mobile end. In April, Baidu said it would launch a mobile-game platform consolidating the resources on 91 Wireless and Duokoo, a subsidiary that provides games, e-books, music and download services. Baidu plans to use its search engine and video sites to generate traffic for its game platform, and then get gamers to use Baidu Tieba, an online community with close to 1 billion users and 8 million groups devoted to different topics. Such a setup would meet the needs of both heavy and casual gamers, Baidu said. Daily downloads of game app has already surpassed 100 million, a company source said. With Tencent already established, Baidu forging ahead with big plans and Alibaba jumping in the game — despite Ma’s concern for China’s youngsters — it’s “game on” in the country’s mobile-game industry.

TCEHY	Chinese online retailer JD.com Inc.’s initial public offering priced above expectations Wednesday, even as investors continue to nurse their wounds from a selloff in high-octane technology stocks. Less than a day before its first day of trading in the U.S. on Thursday, the Beijing-based company and existing shareholders sold 93.7 million American depositary shares for $19 a piece, raising $1.8 billion before the potential sale of additional shares to underwriters, according to people familiar with the matter. JD.com had forecast the shares would fetch $16 to $18 each. JD.com is also offering shares to Huang River Investment Ltd., a unit of Chinese social-media company Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY, -2.58%  , via a private placement valued at $1.3 billion. Altogether, the transaction raised $3.1 billion. The market for U.S. technology IPOs has cooled in recent weeks amid greater investor skepticism surrounding the value of fast-growing, but early-stage companies. Three of the last six such deals have priced below their marketed price ranges, according to Dealogic. Shares of JD.com’s U.S. peer Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -3.20%  are down 24% year-to-date.

TCEHY	"Chinese Internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. said its first-quarter net profit rose 60% from a year earlier on improved revenue from online games. Over the past year, the Shenzhen-based company's earnings have been helped by revenue from its diverse Web services. That has managed to offset a slowdown in ad spending in China as Internet-penetration growth has continued to moderate. The company is also able to make money by selling ads and mobile games on its popular mobile-messaging application, WeChat, which had 395.8 million monthly average users at the end of March. On Wednesday, Tencent said it generated more than 1.8 billion yuan ($289 million) in first-quarter revenue from games released on its mobile-messaging platforms. The news is likely to cheer analysts who have been watching to see how quickly Tencent would be able to make money from its applications, WeChat and Mobile QQ. Tencent said its net profit for the three months ended March 31 rose to CNY6.46 billion ($1.04 billion) from CNY4.04 billion a year earlier. Analysts, according to Thomson Reuters, expected a first-quarter profit of CNY4.86 billion. Revenue rose 36% to CNY18.40 billion from CNY13.55 billion, beating analysts' expectations for CNY18.17 billion. Tencent operates online games including ""Cross Fire"" and ""League of Legends"" as well as games portal QQ Game and social-networking site Qzone. Tencent's strong earnings come even as competition in China's Internet market has intensified. Rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has tried to muscle in on Tencent's turf. The company has been on a buying spree to battle Alibaba for dominance in the world's largest Internet market by users. Over the past eight months, Tencent has struck several deals worth more than $1 billion in total. In March, the company announced a $215 million deal to buy a 15% stake in Chinese e-commerce company JD.com., a smaller Alibaba rival. It also agreed to buy 28% of Korean mobile games firm CJ Games Corp. Meanwhile, e-commerce giant Alibaba has also been strengthening its Internet muscle through acquisitions. Since the start of last year, the Hangzhou-based company has spent more than $3.5 billion on seven acquisitions, including AutoNavi Holdings Ltd., an online mapmaker, and a minority stake in Sina Corp.'s Twitter-like Weibo microblog business.

Property developers and casinos fell broadly in Hong Kong. Among the top decliners, Shimao Property Holdings 0813, -1.82%  dropped by 6%, and Vanke Property (Overseas) 1036, +1.01%    pulled back 5.7%. Macau casino operator Melco Crown Entertainment HK:6883 gave up 4.1%, and both Galaxy Entertainment Group 0027, +1.99%   and MGM China Holdings 2282, +0.00%  were off 3.4%. China’s service sector slowing, too The downward revision to HSBC’s China manufacturing PMI dragged down Hong Kong stocks earlier this week, and now it turns out that HSBC’s services PMI is also on the decline. Shutterstock/And Inc. The April report, released earlier Wednesday, showed the headline number falling to 51.4 from March’s 51.9, though remaining above the 50 level separating expansion from contraction. The details weren’t great either, with the employment subindex hitting a seven-month low to stand just above the 50 mark. HSBC chief China economist Hongbin Qu took a bit of comfort from the fact that, unlike with the manufacturing gauge, the services PMI still indicates a growth in activity. “Today’s release showed that the service sector is still a relatively resilient part of the economy, but it is not expanding at a fast enough pace to offset the manufacturing slowdown,” Qu wrote in comments accompanying the data. Nonetheless, HSBC is holding to its view that China’s economy will remain “on a modest path of expansion over the next few months,” Qu wrote.

TCEHY	Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Tuesday disclosed long-awaited plans for what could be the world's largest initial public offering. Now investors must decide whether to buy the stock. It will be costly. Analysts say Alibaba could be valued at $150 billion to $250 billion. The smaller number would make it as valuable as Facebook Inc. The bigger number would put it on par with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. That may still be a good deal, given Alibaba's size, profitability and growth prospects. The company is by far the world's largest online marketplace, with 231 million active buyers annually. In 2013, roughly $248 billion of merchandise moved through its sites. That's one-third more than the combined transaction volume on Amazon.com Inc. and eBay Inc., according to Forrester Research. Put simply, investing in Alibaba is a bet on China, and its continued rapid growth. Alibaba dominates Chinese e-commerce, with about 80% of the market last year, according to CLSA Research. Its largest site, Taobao, is a free-for-all bazaar featuring hundreds of millions of goods from eight million merchants. Tmall is a higher-end site with products from the likes of Apple Inc., Nike Inc. and Gap Inc. Alibaba generates revenue from sales commissions and advertising by merchants looking to stand out on its marketplaces. Last year, revenue climbed 62%, to $8 billion. That's roughly as much revenue as Facebook, but Alibaba is growing faster; Facebook grew 55% last year. But expenses are relatively small, since Alibaba, like eBay, only provides a marketplace for others and doesn't stock inventory itself. As a result, for every $1 of revenue, Alibaba retains 50 cents as operating profit. That's more than the 37% operating margin at Facebook, and nearly twice the 28% at Google, both considered extraordinarily high for a big U.S. company. Moreover, operating-profit margin has been growing, more than doubling from 20% in 2011. The higher profits for each additional dollar of revenue show how Alibaba is reaping the benefits of its dominant position in Chinese online shopping. And Alibaba appears to have extraordinary growth prospects, which for many investors will justify paying more for $1 of today's profits. China's economy is growing three times as fast as the U.S.'s. A smaller percentage of Chinese are online, 46% compared with the U.S.'s 82%. And the Chinese have fewer retail options, pushing many to shop online. The excitement--and the potential--make it likely investors will have to pay up. Bernstein & Co. analyst Carlos Kirjner says the company is worth up to $250 billion. That's about 70 times last year's profit; Google trades at about 30 times last year's profit. Investors who tend to care more about future profits might consider this math: Even if Alibaba's revenue grows 45% annually through 2015 and its net profit margin expands by one-fifth, Mr. Kirjner's estimated valuation would be nearly 30 times 2015 profits. By comparison, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is trading at about 14 times 2015 earnings. Many U.S. investors will wind up owning a piece of Alibaba without investing directly, through mutual funds that are likely to buy into the Chinese company. Shareholders of Yahoo Inc. already own Alibaba, because Yahoo owns 24% of the Chinese company, though that investment is set to be reduced at the IPO. There are warning signs, too. Alibaba's momentum could slow as determined rivals clip at its heels. Consumer-electronics specialist JD.com Inc., China's second-largest player in online shopping, has won fans among some middle-class Chinese because it offers delivery, as Amazon does in the U.S. Alibaba is far more profitable than JD.com because it doesn't stock inventory itself and works with outside delivery services. But JD.com could pressure the company to invest more in improving customer service. A bigger competitive threat is Chinese social-networking giant Tencent Holdings Ltd., owner of the popular WeChat messaging service. Tencent is expanding its e-commerce business through WeChat and the popular online-payments platform Tenpay, which competes with Alibaba's affiliated Paypal-like service, Alipay. The combination makes Tencent a particular threat on smartphones. A January survey of merchants by RedTech Advisors showed that nearly one-third of Alibaba merchants have opened up a store on WeChat, which is offering commission-free transactions to win them over. In March, Tencent agreed to buy a 15% stake in JD.com. Alibaba's Taobao app is very popular on smartphones, but its own messaging app trails far behind WeChat. RedTech's survey also suggested merchants are grumbling about the high price of Alibaba advertising. That could hamper Alibaba's ability to raise advertising fees and profit margins. Another concern is Alibaba's corporate governance. Alibaba chose to list in New York in part because Hong Kong regulations would have made it hard to keep its partnership structure, under which founder Jack Ma and some other senior executives can nominate more than half of the board directors, even though the partners' combined stake in the company is only about 10%. In 2011, Alibaba transferred ownership of Alipay to an outside company under Mr. Ma's control. The move jolted shares of Yahoo, which owns a 24% stake in Alibaba and claimed it didn't know of the move. The companies resolved their difference with an agreement that limits Yahoo's gains on increases in Alipay's value. People familiar with the matter say a new direct ownership agreement is under discussion between Alibaba and Alipay. Meanwhile, the driving force behind all of this, China's economic miracle, faces its own doubts as critics say growth has been sustained by an investment bubble that could burst.

TCEHY	HONG KONG (MarketWatch) — Asia stocks came under pressure on Monday after HSBC released a disappointing final reading on China’s manufacturing activity in April, adding to concerns of a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index HSI, +1.25%   settled 1.3% lower, and both the Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, +0.06%   and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 XJO, +0.35%   inched up 0.1% at the close. Markets in Japan and South Korea were closed for the Children’s Day holiday. Among the major movers, leading Chinese property developer Evergrande Real Estate Group 3333, +2.34%   fell 2.3% in Hong Kong, rival China Overseas Land & Investment 0688, +1.47%   declined 1.7%, online major Tencent Holdingshk:700 0700, +1.38% TCEHY, -2.58%  lost 0.6%, and telecom giant China Mobile dropped 0.4%. 0941, +2.45% CHL, +0.31%   In Shanghai, property stocks suffered even more, as China Vanke Co. and Poly Real Estate Group tumbled 3.8% and 3.4% respectively. Construction shares advanced, with China Railway Group popping up 3.6%, and China Railway Construction Corp. gaining 2.3%. In Australia, losses in banks were offset by gains in mining shares. Westpac Banking Corp. WBC, +0.17% WBK, -0.85%  gave up 1.2%, and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group ANZ, +0.07% ANZBY, -1.96%  pulled back 1.1%, while Newcreast Mining NCMGY, +0.33% NCM, +0.41%  shot up 3.6% and Alumina tacked on 2.6%. China manufacturing data still ugly Ah, bitter disappointment. HSBC has released the final read of its monthly Chinese manufacturing gauge, with the result weak enough when compared to the preliminary data to pull down stock markets in China. Shutterstock/Laurin Rinder The HSBC Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for April printed at 48.1, weaker than the initial or “flash” reading of 48.3, though still just above the 48.0 result in March. Either way, the result remained below the 50 level that divides expansion from contraction. “Both the new export orders and employment sub-indices contracted, and were revised down from the earlier flash readings. These indicate that the manufacturing sector, and the broader economy as a whole, continues to lose momentum,” wrote HSBC chief China economist Hongbin Qu in remarks released along with the PMI report. Among the few bright spots, the output and new-orders components of the report fell at a slower pace than in March. Kim Eng Securities strategist Andrew Sullivan summarized the problem: “The questions now is, which way is the trend?” Last week, China’s official Purchasing Managers Index PMI reading showed a second successive pick-up in April, rising to 50.4 from 50.3 in March, more or less in line with market expectations. But HSBC’s China PMI focuses on the small and medium-sized enterprises, while the official data focuses on state-owned enterprises. So, Sullivan said, HSBC’s disappointing reading may only reflect that the SME’s are suffering, while the SOE’s are stabilizing. Nonetheless, he said, the weak data from HSBC might prompt some more stimulus from the government over the coming months. TD Securities strategist Annette Beacher didn’t seem too worried about the data, maintaining a forecast for China’s GDP to grow 7.5% during the current June quarter. Despite the disappointing result, she wrote, there might not be any howls of “Chinese hard landing” as it seems clear that HSBC PMI readings of between 48 and 50 are consistent with GDP growth of 7.25% to 7.5%, bang on the government’s target for this year of about 7.5%. ‘Alarming jump’ in Australian inflation While Australia’s statistics bureau reports inflation on a quarterly basis, the people at TD Securities aren’t content to wait so long. So they issue a monthly inflation gauge. And this month, the result was “an alarming jump in headline and trimmed mean inflation, of which only a portion can be attributed to seasonality,” according to Beacher, the firm’s head of Asia-Pacific research. While many economists have penciled in no change this year to the Reserve Bank of Australia’s policy interest rate (currently at 2.5%), Beacher and her colleagues believe the rate will be a half-point higher by the time 2014 ends. “This unwanted inflation, combined with a robust housing sector and signs that prior savings are refueling consumption, suggests that the case for holding the cash rate at record low levels is no longer there,” she writes. The Australian dollar saw a brief, sharp bump up after the TD Securities data (see the previous post on this blog, when the Aussie AUDUSD, +0.3266%  was buying 92.86 U.S. cents). However, the gain for the currency proved transitory, quickly moving back to 92.75 U.S. cents, around the level just prior to the data release. Japan closed, but ... hey, Softbank! As the East Asia spring holiday season enters the home stretch, Japan and South Korea are marking Children’s Day, a festival meant to celebrate children and, in Japan at least, to fly colorful kites with pictures of carp on them. But no amount of fish-bedecked kites can stop the news, and if Tokyo were open today, we’d for sure be watching shares of Softbank 9984, -0.50% This, as the Nikkei newspaper says the telecom is expected to report a sharp rise in profit in its annual results due out Wednesday, “driven by its aggressive buying spree.” According the English-language version of the report: “This would mark an 80% jump from fiscal 2012, although based on different accounting standards.” And significantly, it would give Softbank (owner of Sprint, among others) the title of Japan’s top wireless carrier, surpassing current industry leader NTT DoCoMo 9437, +0.11% NTDMF, +4.86%  . While Japanese markets aren’t scheduled to reopen until Wednesday (tomorrow is “Greenery Day”), and while a lot can happen between now and then, Softbank’s American Depositary Shares will trade in the U.S. For reference, Softbank’s SFTBY shares SFTBY, -1.48% closed Friday at $38.35, a gain of 1.2%, while the SFTBF shares SFTBF, -2.81%  rose 1.5% to $76.69. Whether they will rise on the news or induce profit-taking is for you to decide. Also getting the Nikkei treatment is Japan’s top department-store operator Isetan Mitsukoshi 3099, -0.25%  , though here the benefit to the shares is less clear. The Nikkei writes that Mitsukoshi should report a “fresh record-high group operating profit for the third year in a row,” but the gain is just 3%, and group sales are projected to slip by 2%.

TCEHY	Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. dominates China's e-commerce market, which by one measure is now the biggest in the world. The best way to understand Alibaba is as a mix of Amazon.com, eBay and PayPal with a dash of Google thrown in, all with some uniquely Chinese characteristics. Unlike Amazon, which buys goods from suppliers and sells them to customers, Alibaba has always acted as a middleman, connecting buyers and sellers and facilitating transactions between them. While it isn't an auction company, its middleman role is similar to the one played by eBay. Taobao, Alibaba's biggest website, is like a gigantic Chinese bazaar with about 760 million product listings from 7 million sellers. Merchants don't pay to sell products on Taobao--and that fee-free model is a big part of its appeal in China. Instead, they pay Alibaba for advertising and other services to allow them to stand out from the crowd. Much like on Google, the ads from merchants appear with Taobao's product-search results. While Taobao is mostly for small merchants, Tmall, another shopping site run by Alibaba, is designed for bigger merchants, including some well-known brands such as Nike and Gap. Earlier this year, Apple Inc. opened its store on Tmall. Unlike Taobao, Tmall, which has about 70,000 merchants, charges each seller a deposit, annual fee and a commission fee on each transaction. What sets Alibaba apart is size. The company has said Taobao and Tmall account for more than half of all parcel deliveries in China. By one measure, Alibaba has already surpassed U.S. e-commerce firms. In 2012, the combined transaction volume of Taobao and Tmall topped one trillion yuan ($162 billion), larger than the 2012 totals for Amazon and eBay combined. Alibaba's revenues are a fraction of Amazon's because it doesn't actually sell the products on its site. But the Chinese company is far more profitable. In the three months through September, the most recent numbers available, Alibaba's revenue rose 51% to $1.776 billion from a year earlier. Net profit stood at $792 million, giving the company a net profit margin of 44.6%, according to shareholder Yahoo Inc., which owns a 24% stake in Alibaba. In the same quarter, Amazon posted a loss of $41 million on revenue of $17.09 billion. The company has also emerged as a huge player in China's creaky financial system. To solve the problem of buyers trusting the merchants on the site, Alibaba created Alipay, which is a payment system that protects buyers if sellers don't deliver. Alipay has become so ingrained in China, that when the company launched a money-market fund, it grew to be one of the world's largest in just eight months. Alibaba now does micro lending and is taking part in the Chinese government's program to set up five private banks on a trial basis in some big cities. Run by an affiliate of Alibaba, the payment system has allowed the company to accumulate a vast amount of information on Chinese small businesses, consumers and their online transactions. Even though Alibaba is still by far the biggest player in China's fast-growing e-commerce market, the company is facing stiffer competition as more Chinese consumers use smartphones. In this new environment, social media and online gaming giant Tencent Holdings Ltd., which operates massively popular WeChat mobile messaging application, is emerging as a powerful competitor to Alibaba, because of its ability to use WeChat as a mobile-based platform to offer other services such as e-commerce. To further bolster its e-commerce capabilities, Tencent earlier this month announced a deal to buy a 15% stake in JD.com Inc., China's second-largest e-commerce firm. Alibaba has fought back with a string of deals, including its offer last month to pay $1.13 billion for the 72% stake in Chinese online map company AutoNavi that it didn't already own and a $585.8 million investment last year for a 18% stake in Sina Weibo, the popular microblogging site majority-owned by Sina Corp. Weibo unveiled plans Friday to sell $500 million of stock in the U.S. Alibaba was founded in 1999 by Jack Ma, an English teacher in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, when the Internet as a concept was still foreign to many Chinese businesses even though the dot-com bubble was taking the U.S. by storm. Mr. Ma and 17 other founding members launched Alibaba.com., a trading website that connects Chinese manufacturers with overseas clients. Shortly after eBay entered the Chinese market by buying a stake in a local e-commerce company, Alibaba launched Taobao in 2003 to enter a consumer e-commerce business, at a time when China's Internet user population was growing rapidly.

TCEHY	China’s social-media service Weibo Corp. has filed plans to raise up to $500 million in an initial public offering in the U.S., with plans to use proceeds to repay loans and invest in technology and marketing. Weibo’s plan to launch an IPO comes after The Wall Street Journal last month reported the company’s owner, Sina Corp. SINA, -2.65% was looking to take the Twitter-like service public. Weibo’s main competitor is Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY, -2.58% which owns the popular WeChat instant-messaging app and poses an increasing threat to the service. Weibo listed Tencent and several other competitors as a risk factor in its IPO filing, saying online and mobile services were competing with each other, as well as traditional media outlets such as print and TV, for money spent by advertisers. Weibo also faces pressure on the political front. Last year, the Chinese government cracked down on some of the service’s biggest personalities.

TCEHY	"BEIJING--China's central bank is temporarily suspending the use of two forms of smartphone payments in a setback for China's two largest Internet companies as they try to gain a larger share of the online finance market. State-owned People's Daily, in its online edition, cited a People's Bank of China official Friday as saying that the central bank would halt the use of QR codes and virtual credit cards in smartphone payment systems. The official said the bank was examining potential security risks to users of those two payment platforms. The People's Bank of China didn't respond to a request for comment. Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Alibaba Group Holding have been aggressively expanding their smartphone payment operations in a bid to get consumers to use their services to directly pay for goods and services. The two companies have wielded increasing power as China's more than 500 million smartphone users take to their phones to do everything from ordering and paying for a taxi to shopping online. A spokeswoman for Alibaba didn't respond to a request for comment. A Tencent spokesman said the company continually reviews its service and would take action if necessary. ""We continually review and take measures on suspicious cases of spam, violent, pornographic and illegal content. We also welcome users to report to us online or through our 24-hour hotline,"" the spokesman said. Earlier this week, both Tencent and Alibaba announced virtual credit card programs in cooperation with China Citic Bank, extending credit lines directly to users over their smartphones. The credit lines could then be used to purchase goods through e-commerce sites that supported Citic's credit cards. QR Codes have also emerged as a popular way to facilitate direct payments between two people with smartphones. The code, a complex pattern that can be scanned by smartphones, has been increasingly used by Internet companies as one step in the transfer of funds via smartphones. The People's Daily report said the halt was designed to give the central bank time to assess the risks of the new technology. Still, it is a worrying sign for the two Internet giants, which have spent hundreds of millions of dollars buying up smaller businesses to facilitate transactions between smartphone users and businesses. The news sent Tencent's shares down 5% in early morning trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to 558.50 Hong Kong dollars (US$71.9). The benchmark Hang Seng Index was down 1%.

TCEHY	BEIJING--China will set up five private banks as part of its program to bring private capital into the state-dominated banking sector, the nation's bank regulator said Tuesday. Programs will be rolled out on a trial basis in the cities of Tianjin and Shanghai as well as in Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces, Shang Fulin, chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC), said Tuesday. Mr. Shang told a news conference that each bank will have at least two private co-sponsors. Asked about the timetable, he said that depends on when the banks are ready. He did not elaborate. Ten private companies, including e-commerce giants Alibaba Group Holdings and Tencent Holdings Ltd. (0700.HK), have been selected to take part in the preparation work to set up private banks, state-run newspaper the People's Daily reported Tuesday. Other companies include units from China's biggest auto parts maker Wanxiang Group, aviation services and travel company JuneYao Group and Fosun Group, a conglomerate that has operations in finance, property and medical services, according to the paper. China's banking system has long been dominated by the state, leading to complaints from private firms that state banks prefer to lend to the state sector, forcing them to scramble for funds. But China's top leaders have been trying to open up the economy to more competition and tap private capital to help spur economic growth. The creation of private banks, which is part of those plans, received a major boost at a key policy-setting meeting of senior members of the Communist Party in November.

TCEHY	BEIJING--Chinese Internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. is joining forces with China's second-largest e-commerce player, JD.com Inc., in a new partnership aimed at heating up competition with Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. Tencent will take a 15% stake in JD.com for $215 million with the obligation to take an additional 5% of the online retailer after it lists in the U.S. JD.com is currently preparing for a $1.5 billion U.S. listing, ahead of a much-anticipated listing by bigger rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. According to an agreement announced Monday, Tencent will support JD.com by driving traffic to the company's e-commerce services through its popular WeChat and QQ mobile messaging services, while JD.com will take over Tencent's Wanggou and PaiPai e-commerce units. The tie-up between the two is the most recent in a raft of acquisitions and investments by China's largest three Internet companies, which are tapping cash reserves as they rush to attract China's growing numbers of smartphone users. Tencent, the largest social media and gaming company in China, is likely to make use of the massive traffic flows to its websites and mobile apps to help JD.com sell products. In recent years Tencent has invested heavily in e-commerce as a bid to compete with Alibaba and open a new revenue stream, but analysts have been mixed on the investments, as they led Tencent into a capital-intensive industry beset by price wars. JD.com is China's second-largest e-commerce company, in the critical business-to-consumer space, by transaction value behind Alibaba. Unlike Alibaba, JD.com uses a model much closer to that of Amazon.com in the U.S., purchasing and holding inventory in its own warehouses and then making use of its own logistics system to deliver goods quickly to users across China. In contrast, Alibaba facilitates the sale of goods by third-party companies and then also uses third-party logistics firms to deliver the orders. As of the end of September, JD.com had 35.8 million active customer accounts, the company said in its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Meanwhile at the end of the third quarter, Tencent had more than 272 million monthly active users, mainly in China. Late last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that Tencent appointed Barclays PLC to advise it on the purchase of a stake in JD.com.

TCEHY	"BEIJING--China's securities regulator confirmed Friday that it is working with other agencies to study measures to oversee Internet finance businesses. The sector has some problems and risks that need to be further regulated, said Zhang Xiaojun, a spokesman for the China Securities Regulatory Commission, at a regular briefing. He didn't elaborate. The CSRC has an ""overall supportive attitude"" toward the sector because it helps to resolve the financing difficulties of small businesses, Mr. Zhang said. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that China's central bank is leading a government effort to stem potential risk from a new generation of popular online investment products, citing people familiar with the matter. Officials are looking to develop regulations aimed squarely at products offered by Internet companies such as an affiliate of e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Baidu Inc. The companies declined to comment. Officials stressed that they hope the Internet companies could still play a role in making China's creaky financial system more competitive, improving the flow of lending to small businesses and encouraging greater competition from stodgy state-run banks.

TCEHY	China e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is set to roll out its first wealth management product Friday after launching its popular Yu'E Bao investment service, according to Alibaba's payment affiliate. The fixed-term investment product to be launched by the company and affiliate Alipay is expected to offer investors an annualized return of 7%, while its principal is also guaranteed, according to the payment company. In China, wealth-management products are deposit-like investment products offering higher returns than bank deposits for a fixed period. The latest product marks the continuing proliferation and evolution of financial services offered by China's large Internet companies. In June, Alibaba began offering Yu'e Bao, a money-market-like fund that allows investors to withdraw money instantly. China's Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Baidu Inc. have since launched similar products. Grace Zhu and Paul Mozur contributed to this as article.

TCEHY	BEIJING--Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.'s online payment affiliate has struck a deal with Sina Corp. SINA, -2.65% to launch an online payment service as competition rises between the e-commerce giant and rival Tencent Holdings Ltd. (0700.HK). The affiliate, called Alipay, said on its official microblog account that the new service allows users of Sina's Weibo microblog service to make online and offline payments through their Alipay accounts. The move follows Alibaba's deal last year to acquire an 18% stake in Weibo from Sina for $586 million. Alibaba is China's largest electronic commerce company by sales volume. It has branched out in recent months into social media with its Weibo investment and into financial services by offering money-market-like investment products to savers. Rival Tencent maintains the fast-growing WeChat mobile texting app, which has its own online payment service that allows users to pay through their bank accounts. It has also increasingly offered financial services and is investing more in its e-commerce operations. Alipay's parent is controlled by Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma, but Alipay isn't part of the main e-commerce company, which is exploring an initial public offering in the U.S. or Hong Kong.

TCEHY	Bloomberg The Snapchat Inc. logo stands outside the company's headquarters on the strand at Venice Beach. SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — Facing difficulties keeping teen users, Facebook Inc. reportedly has made a bid for popular instant messaging site Snapshot. The Wall Street Journal reported Facebook made a $3 billion bid for Snapchat. Facebook FB, -1.34%  made its bid as other investors reported expressed interest for the popular site, the newspaper said, citing unnamed sources. Facebook does not comment on speculation and rumors, a spokeswoman told MarketWatch. Shares of Facebook were up 3% on Wednesday. Read: 5 social sites cooler than Facebook for teens. Snapchat emerged as the latest social-media craze as a messaging service that allows users, many of them teens, to send photos that get erased after a few seconds after they are sent. As an increasingly popular site for young users, it’s known to be a rival to Facebook when it comes to teenagers. The report said that among the interested parties was the Chinese e-commerce company Tencent Holdings 0700, +1.33% TCEHY, -2.58%  , which reportedly offered to lead an investment in a bid that would value Snapchat at $4 billion. Snapchat’s co-founder and chief executive, Evan Spiegel, will probably not consider a sale or an investment until early next year, the report said. News of Facebook’s bid follows increasing worries about the social network’s following among teens. The Menlo Park, Calif.-based company last month spooked investors after it disclosed declining teen usage in the U.S. Analysts had been pointing the risk of an eroding teen base at Facebook as young people to other social media sites, including Snapchat. Facebook has been taking steps apparently aimed at shoring up its teen base. The company recently an anti-bullying hub geared to helping young people deal with the problem. Facebook also changed its policy by allowing teens to post publicly. Crawford Del Prete, an analyst at IDC, said Facebook may have made the bid for Snapchat as a way to expand its technology. “In my opinion this makes sense,” he told MarketWatch. “Facebook needs fresh tools to stay relevant. This falls into that category of IP [intellectual property].” Reported interest in Snapchat comes a week after Twitter Inc.’s TWTR, -1.89%  successful initial public offering, seen as sign of strong investor interest in social media companies.

TCEHY	"BEIJING--Sina Corp.'s SINA, -2.65% third-quarter net profit more than doubled as the Chinese Internet company made strides toward making money off its Weibo social media platform, while rival Tencent Holdings Ltd. (0700.HK) logged modest profit growth on higher advertising and gaming revenue. Tencent has benefited from its diverse Web services, which have offset a slowdown in ad spending in China. Economic growth in the country has slowed and the Internet industry is maturing but an increasing shift of Chinese Internet users to smartphones means the company's WeChat messaging application will be watched closely. Since the product was introduced more than two years ago, Tencent has mostly held off on taking measures to make money off of it. But a recent upgrade to the application earlier this month includes a number of potential revenue generators, such as games and a mobile payment service. Tencent said WeChat now has 272 million monthly active users and it will continue to introduce new self-developed and third-party games into its WeChat and mobile QQ chat applications. Sina said both revenue and total daily active users grew during the third quarter compared with the second, in part due to an alliance it struck up with Chinese electronic-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. earlier this year. Sina Chief Executive Charles Chao told investors on Wednesday that the partnership with Alibaba has helped drive revenue growth for Weibo, but added the company remained cautious about placing too many ads into the service. ""Although it looks like we're approaching the break-even line with our Weibo business...our long-term goal is still to build an ecosystem surrounding the social media platform, conscious of finding a balance between making money and user experience,"" he said. The growth in revenue for Sina's Twitter-like Weibo service comes amid a government crackdown in social media, and is the biggest indication yet that Sina can make money off the service despite increasing censorship of some of the service's most popular commentators. During its earnings call, Mr. Chao said the time spent by users on Weibo stayed flat from the previous quarter, while total daily active users grew 11.2% to 60.2 million by the end of September from the end of June. Weibo advertising revenues for the third quarter of 2013 more than doubled to $43.7 million compared with the year-earlier period. Sina also makes money from its online portal business. To contend with Weibo's revenue issues, Sina struck a $586 million deal earlier this year giving Alibaba an 18% stake in the social network. Sina had said it expects the partnership to generate $380 million in ad and social-commerce revenue over the next three years. Mr. Chao also said the company was looking to follow the cues of Alibaba and Baidu Inc. (BIDU) and begin selling financial products online before the end of the year. He said the sale of investments could capitalize on the many users who read Sina's financial news each day. For the third quarter, Sina posted a profit of $25.4 million, or 37 cents a share, up from a profit of $9.9 million, or 14 cents a share, a year ago. Excluding items, profit rose to 42 cents a share from 17 cents. Analysts were expecting a per-share profit of 32 cents. Net revenue rose 21% to $184.6 million. Adjusted revenue, which excludes the impact of deferred-license revenue, was up 22% at $179.9 million. The company in August had forecast adjusted revenue of $176 million to $180 million. Gross margin widened to 64% from 54%. Advertising revenue increased 26% to $151.6 million, while nonadvertising revenue was up 4.1% to $33.1 million. Through Tuesday's close, the stock was up 51% so far this year. Tencent said net profit for the three months ended Sept. 30 rose to CNY3.87 billion ($631 million) from CNY3.22 billion a year earlier. The result was worse than the average CNY3.93 billion net profit forecast of nine analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 34% to CNY15.54 billion from CNY11.57 billion, in line with the CNY15.54 billion forecast in the poll. Shenzhen-based Tencent operates online games like Cross Fire and League of Legends as well as platforms including instant-messaging service QQ, mobile messaging service WeChat, games portal QQ Game and social-networking site Qzone.

TCEHY	As the end of the year approaches and the S&P 500 SPX, -2.19%  keeps setting new highs, it seems right to talk about taking some money off the table in U.S. stocks and rebalancing your portfolio. This is particularly apt advice for traders riding domestic momentum darlings like Tesla TSLA, -2.10% and Facebook FB, -1.34% which have started to look shaky after big runs to start the year. Reuters The conductor of a military band performs during the rehearsal ahead of a recent party conference. Of course, the million dollar question remains where to put any free cash if you sell a partial stake in a big winner. With rates still rock bottom and the Fed showing no signs of letting its foot off the gas, “risk on” equities have a clear edge over interest-bearing assets. So if not admittedly frothy U.S. stocks, then where? I say China. China looks cheap If you’re worried about overvalued equities, then China is very appealing. By many measures it’s one of the cheapest stock markets in the world right now. Philippines Death Toll Could Reach 10,000 The Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, +0.17%  trades for about 1.4 times net assets, a discount of over 40% compared with the S&P. And as Oaktree Capital’s chairman Howard Marks told Bloomberg last week, “The Shanghai Composite’s price-to-book ratio is about half the level it reached in November 2010, while the measure’s price-to-earnings multiple is 42% lower.” Separately, at the end of October Financial Times estimates showed Chinese equities trade at a P/E of 7 with a 4.6% dividend yield on average. It’s worth noting that multiple expansion for U.S. stocks is a sign of a bull market to some. Also, there’s no guarantee that China stocks trading for a P/E of 7 have to soar and bring that earnings multiple higher. One way for price-to-earnings calculations to adjust is simply for the E to go down instead of the P to go up. But it’s worth considering the big differences between the U.S. and China right now on the valuation front. If you think investors are too bullish on domestic equity, you may also find logic in the argument that investors are also too bearish on China right now. Manufacturing and commodities outlook is better At the end of October, the dollar index DXY, +0.06%  , a measure of the U.S. currency vs. a basket of foreign peers, fell to its lowest levels since February. And while there has admittedly been a bit of a rally off the bottom, the dollar remains significantly below levels seen this spring and summer. That weakness in the greenback will create a floor for commodity prices, and help Chinese materials and mining companies as a result of higher prices. And as a broader measure of demand, consider that China’s manufacturing sector continues to bounce back. In October, China PMI came in at the strongest level in 18 months. Bigger picture, China gross domestic product expansion accelerated to 7.8% in the third quarter, up from 7.5% in Q2 and bringing growth rates to 7.7% for the first nine months of 2013 — nicely above the 7.5% GDP target set in Beijing. And let’s not forget that signs of a recovery in the U.S. and Europe will undoubtedly have a trickle-down affect. China is the world’s largest trading nation with total exports and imports of almost $4 trillion, so the fact that Europe has exited recession and that American unemployment continues to slowly heal could lend to the long-term recovery hopes of China and its manufacturers that send products here. There are certainly problems as the nation transitions to a consumer-driven economy and the growth in China’s manufacturing in recent months may roll back. But for now, the direction is very encouraging. How to buy China The risk for many investors, of course, isn’t simply identifying the opportunity in Chinese stocks but how to practically invest in this trend. The simplest solution for low-risk investors looking for China exposure but not massive weighting in Asia is to go multinational. Whether it’s Yum! Brands YUM, -1.80%  with its huge restaurant presence in China or chip companies like Broadcom US:BRCM and Qualcomm QCOM, -3.49% that supply electronics firms here, there are plenty of ways to get exposure in companies you are familiar with — and more importantly, companies that are easy to trade and must adhere to U.S. securities law in their conduct. If simply buying a U.S. stock that does business in China isn’t direct enough, consider focused China funds like the iShares China Large-Cap ETF FXI, -2.17% This ETF has top holdings headquartered directly in China, including Chinese oil majors like PetroChina PTR, -2.37% internet giant Tencent Holdings TCEHY, -2.58% and the massive Agricultural Bank of China ACGBY, -2.80%   to name a few. And, of course, you could buy any of those individual China stocks, presuming you are comfortable doing your own research on a company that’s halfway around the world, and presuming you understand the risk of investing in a state-run enterprise like PetroChina that has the blessing of Beijing and a much higher likelihood of corruption, waste or murky reporting practices. It’s also worth noting that Beijing just approved the first ETFs to track mainland China stocks — not ADRs or Hong Kong-listed issues like the companies that make up the FXI. Though the distinction seems academic, the advantage for investors is exposure to players that do not list abroad as well as the ability to trade equities that move during China market hours during the Chinese news cycle instead of on New York time halfway around the world. These funds aren’t on the market yet, however, so for the time being I would recommend sticking with multinationals or dedicated China funds if you like this investment strategy. There’s obviously risk in China, and the hopes of recovery right now could be just another head fake. But there are risks in U.S. equity right now, too. If you’re rebalancing at the end of the year or taking money off the table in cooling tech stocks, it may be worth looking into Chinese stocks instead of some of the frothy picks on U.S. markets right now.

TCEHY	BEIJING--Baidu Inc. BIDU, -2.55% will introduce a new financial product next week when it unveils a financial services platform, part of an effort to compete with Internet rivals like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which are moving more aggressively into the financial sector. The product, which Baidu says is targeting 8% annual returns, will be part of cooperation with China Asset Management (Hong Kong) Ltd. The minimum investment for the product will be only 1 yuan ($0.16). The company also said it would eventually cooperate with other financial institutions to offer investment opportunities to customers, who it said search for terms like 'finance' on Baidu's search engine--by far China's most popular--many millions of times each day. Baidu's new financial services arm, which will be formally introduced on Oct. 28, comes as its two larger rivals--Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd. (0700.HK) -- have moved increasingly to connect their large numbers of users with investment and other financial products. Just last week, the top management at Alibaba's finance affiliate said the company would cooperate with financial institutions to expand its offerings of financial products. The executives also downplayed concerns about China's financial regulators curtailing moves by private Internet firms into the sector. Tencent confirmed earlier this month that it was a minority shareholder in a consortium formed to seek a banking license from the Chinese government. Though Baidu declined to elaborate on the product, the low minimum investment and the marketing to regular online users resembles a service Alibaba introduced in May. That service lets users with money stored online on Alipay, which allows users to make direct transactions online, invest in a fund pegged to corporate debt and government bonds. The rash of financial services come in a market in which Chinese investors, particularly those with modest savings, have had limited low-risk investment opportunities. Some have worried that the rapid expansion by private companies like Alibaba and Baidu into a sector dominated by state-run banks and protected by conservative regulators could lead to problems as entrenched interests in the sector fight back against the competition.

TCEHY	If you’re bearish on domestic equity right now, you’re not alone. A host of risk factors are creating risk for American stocks including governmental gridlock, a weak outlook for third-quarter earnings and a general fear that a red-hot 2013 has left little upside for stocks in the medium term after a big run in U.S. stocks. So if you’re down on American investments, why not look abroad? Sure, there are big risks overseas what with slowing growth in China, ugly performance for emerging markets, constant turmoil in the Middle East and persistently high unemployment in Europe. Colleges Try Cutting Tuition ... and Aid But by investing in diversified ETFs, investors can spread their risk around across sectors or geographic areas, adding a global flavor to their portfolios at a time when looking overseas could be the best path to growth. • Need to Know: Critical intelligence before the U.S. markets open Furthermore, while investing in foreign companies isn’t impossible, it’s often complicated for many retail investors. Thus, it’s much easier to simply buy a global ETF in your current brokerage account rather than worry about the logistics of buying stocks listed overseas — or more importantly, figuring out how to do research on companies that don’t trade in the U.S. and aren’t subject to the same SEC rules as domestic blue chips. So if you’re looking to make a move right now but don’t like the prospect of investing in domestic equity, here are three global funds to consider for your portfolio: the SPDR S&P International Dividend ETF DWX, -0.43%  , the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF VGK, -0.33%  , and the iShares China Large-Cap ETF FXI, -2.17%  .

TCEHY	BEIJING (Caixin Online) — Competition for fresh-faced university graduates is heating up in China’s telecom sector now that electronics equipment giant Huawei Technologies Co. has significantly hiked salaries for certain white collar employees. The pay decision is also a signal that the world’s largest manufacturer of telecom gear remains committed to an ongoing expansion that encompasses new arenas, such as consumer smartphones. First-year worker and junior executive paychecks were pushed up by as much as 35% in August following a July 29 announcement by the Shenzhen-based company.  ABOUT CAIXIN Caixin is a Beijing-based media group dedicated to providing high-quality and authoritative financial and business news and information through periodicals, online and TV/video programs. • Get the Caixin e-newsletter Just a week earlier, Huawei’s biggest domestic rival, ZTE Communications 0763, +7.00% 000063, -0.10% ZTCOY, -3.73%  unveiled a new equity incentive plan designed to retain key white collar workers. The company said it would distribute about 103 million company shares as bonus compensation for 1,531 select employees. Huawei’s pay hikes not only upstaged ZTE’s highly touted incentives program but also brought its salary scale a notch closer to levels offered in the country by foreign competitors including telecom multinationals Ericsson, Nokia NOK, -0.37% FI:NOK1V  Siemens SIE, -0.19% US:SI  and Samsung 005930, +1.65% SSNLF, -3.07% Probationary salaries for 2014 college graduates hired by Huawei will rise to more than 9,000 yuan ($1,470) per month from 6,500 yuan USDCNY, +0.1634% Master’s degree graduates will be offered more than 10,000 yuan a month to start, up from 8,000 yuan, the company said. Altogether, Huawei said it would boost the companywide payroll by more than 1 billion yuan. Performance-related pay hikes will range from 25% to 30%, depending on the type of work. Management thus hopes to attract and retain employees in a competitive labor environment where Nokia, Siemens and other foreign companies generally offer new bachelor’s degree graduates at their China divisions between 8,000 and 10,000 yuan per month, said Wei Xiaokang, a headhunter for Beijing-based Offercome, which focuses on matching jobs and job seekers in the Internet industry. “Huawei’s workplace environment is more intense than that of Ericsson and other multinational companies,” Wei said. “But the pay is lower.” Huawei has also been fishing for talent in ZTE. Indeed, according to a ZTE source, the Huawei pay increases “drove ZTE (management) crazy” because in the first half of 2013 “a number of people” left ZTE for jobs at Huawei. Reuters A man looks at a Huawei mobile phone as he shops at an electronic market in Shanghai Jan. 22, 2013. ZTE employs an estimated 50,000 to 60,000 people, one-third as many as Huawei. “Raising junior executive salaries on such a large scale, as Huawei has done, undoubtedly marks a significant change in remuneration policy,” said Wei. And it’s a surprising change for the company’s labor policy considering the weak business atmosphere in the telecom industry, where of late many companies have been downsizing, trimming costs and reducing product lineups. Financial strength Huawei was apparently in a better position to raise wages than its rivals thanks to high revenue growth during the first half of 2013, says Deutsche Telekom International Consulting’s director in China, Fang Honggang. Privately held Huawei, which releases only sales revenue and net profit margin figures in its financial statements, reported “relatively optimistic… accounts receivable, bad debt treatment and possible risks,” Fang said. Huawei reported sales of 113.8 billion yuan for the first six months of the year, up 10.8% over the same period of 2012. Moreover, company management forecast a 2013 net profit margin of 7% to 8%. A Renmin University professor who also serves as a Huawei corporate management adviser, Wu Chunbo, said the company’s first half 2013 net profit was 14.3 billion yuan. With the company on a sound financial footing, management was well prepared to turn attention to making junior executive salaries more competitive, a Huawei representative said. Huawei has been in an especially good position to raise starting paychecks for graduates of Chinese universities in step with recent recruiting drives by Internet sector companies overseas, said Wei. Companies including Google GOOG, -2.02%  and Facebook FB, -1.34%  last year offered more than 100 graduates of major Chinese colleges annual salaries of about $100,000. The new hires hailed from schools such as Peking University and Tsinghua University, as well as the graduate school of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Telecom and Internet sector companies also recruit graduates from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University and Beijing University of Science and Technology. Of the estimated 7,000 students who graduate from these top schools every year, foreign Internet companies hire about 100, said Wei. Chinese Internet giants such as Baidu BIDU, -2.55% Alibaba and Tencent 0700, +1.38% TCEHY, -2.58%  attract up to 3,000 graduates annually, while information technology firms and banks take about 1,000 from these schools and domestic telecom operators hire nearly 1,000.  • MarketWatch Topics: Middle East • | | • | | • U.S.: |  TOOLS • Latin American and Canadian indexes • European indexes | Asian indexes  MORE ON THE MARKETS • Global Economic Calendar • | | Earnings Watch • | U.S. Economic Calendar Domestic, Internet-related companies such as game developer Perfect World US:PWRD  and Net Ease Games have been offering hefty salaries as well, sometimes as much as 33,000 yuan a month for newly graduated hires. The Chinese search engine Baidu and e-commerce giant Alibaba have been offering newcomers up to 16,000 yuan a month. Chinese banks and other companies with large IT departments have been attracting talent, too, adding to the pressure on Huawei to fill its key staffing needs. “Professional salaries in communications, IT and the Internet have generally increased,” said Wei. “If Huawei had continued following its previous remuneration policy, meeting the goals of each annual recruitment program would have been increasingly difficult.” Unlike ZTE, Huawei executives decided to raise salaries rather than offer stock incentives. A Huawei human resources manager said equity packages are actually weak incentives for junior staffers. A junior employee who takes advantage of the existing Huawei equity incentives program may accumulate up to 20,000 shares after three years of working for the company, thus earning 30,000 yuan a year in dividends. But this kind of employee has to invest a large amount of money to acquire those shares, said a Huawei middle manager, which can make the offer seem unattractive. Employees who have worked at Huawei for more than a decade may earn only about 2,500 yuan a month, but they reap stock dividends and related bonuses that can bring an annual salary close to 1 million yuan, the manager said. Fang calls the pay structure at Huawei “a mismatch between new and old employees” that highlights the need for Huawei “to carry out deep reform of its remuneration policy. This wage adjustment for junior employees is only the beginning.” Expansion groundwork The pay adjustment is intended to help Huawei locate the talent it will need to staff the company’s business departments of the future. For example, a recent shift to more smartphone-related business to complement its traditional focus on telecom equipment means the company “needs fresh strength to help itself pioneer” new areas, Fang said. “Huawei isn’t focusing on companies like ZTE and Ericsson” as potential sources for new employees but “needs to take talent from IT and Internet companies such as Google, Baidu, Apple AAPL, -2.56% IBM IBM, -2.25%  and Cisco CSCO, -2.61% Chinese Students Stay Home for Western Education Huawei has indeed been steadily expanding, even while competitors in the telecom equipment market have been shrinking in recent years. It has aggressively entered the European, Asian, African and Latin American markets, eroding competitor market shares. Huawei topped Ericsson for the first time in 2012 as the world’s largest telecom equipment maker, with annual revenues of 220 billion yuan. It employs about 155,000, compared to Ericsson’s 110,000. Over the next five years, said Wu, Huawei will continue to expand and correspondingly adjust its human resources policies. Huawei officials said in April they expect sales to grow 10% annually through 2017, with sales of consumer goods such as handheld devices contributing an ever-larger share of revenues. “The telecom equipment market structure has been initially set and margins are declining,” Fang said, “Huawei’s ambitions are no longer restricted to this industry. It is currently transforming toward the information and communications technology industry.” Huawei’s handset sales were $4.3 billion in the first half this year. It recently acquired 127 hectares in Dongguan, Guangdong Province, for a handset research and development base, and has invested $200 million in a program aimed at building a global handset brand, said Fang. Huawei is also ramping up corporate services in the areas of Internet protocol, IT products and data communications for companies in the financial, railroad, civil aviation and oil industries. Corporate service sales are expected to reach $2.7 billion this year, up about 45% from last year, said Fang. Read this report on Caixin Online. Follow Caixin on Twitter at @Caixin.

TCEHY	"BEIJING--China Mobile Ltd. (0941.HK, K3PD.SG, CHL) said Thursday net profit in the first half of the year rose 1.5%, slightly beating expectations even as the slow growth signaled that China's largest mobile carrier continues to struggle with competition from local rivals. The continued slow growth comes as the world's largest mobile carrier, with more than 700 million customers, is plowing almost $7 billion this year into building a new, speedier fourth-generation network as it fights to retain supremacy over rivals China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. (0762.HK, K3ID.SG, CHU) and China Telecom Corp. (0728.HK, K3ED.SG, CHA). The large investment, along with an expected increase in subsidies to boost sales of high-end phones, has lifted anticipation of the company's future competitiveness, but also has prompted analysts to warn about flagging profitability in 2013. Though China Mobile is far and away China's largest carrier, profit growth has slowed in part because the company was saddled with a proprietary third-generation Chinese standard not commonly used outside the country. Among other problems, that left China Mobile unable to offer popular phones such as Apple Inc.'s AAPL, -2.56% iPhone. As Chinese consumers have rushed to buy touch-screen smartphones that run on 3G networks, they have increasingly bought services from China Unicom and China Telecom. Nonetheless, China Mobile's revenue growth was helped in the first half by strong sales of smartphones using its TD-SCDMA mobile standard. In its earnings report the company said it sold 66 million handsets in the first half. The world's largest mobile carrier by number of accounts said net profit for the six months ended June 30 rose to 63.1 billion yuan from CNY62.20 billion a year earlier. Net profit was higher than the average CNY62.338 billion forecast of three analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. China Mobile's operating revenue in the period rose 10.4% to CNY303.1 billion from CNY266.53 billion, better than the average CNY281.42 billion forecast in the poll. China Mobile also has been hampered by a surge in the use of applications on smartphones, which has hit revenue growth from traditional text and voice services. Applications such as Tencent Holdings Ltd.'s (0700.HK, TCEHY) WeChat allow users to send voice and text messages free of charge, leading many users to make fewer phone calls and send fewer traditional text messages. ""There is ... a growing substitution effect brought on by the Internet business, causing more intense cross-sector competition. These challenges pose a threat to the Group's market position and an increasing downward pressure on its development,"" Chairman Xi Guohua wrote in its earnings release. China Mobile declared a first-half dividend of HK$1.696, up from HK$1.633 a year earlier.

TCEHY	HONG KONG (MarketWatch) — Japanese stocks retreated Monday as several financial and technology firms pulled back from strong recent advances, while mainland Chinese shares edged higher after data showing an improvement in services-sector activity in the country. The Nikkei Stock Average NIK, +0.51%  fell 1.4% in Tokyo, after rallying in the previous two sessions, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 XJO, +0.35%  slipped 0.1% and South Korea’s Kospi SEU, +0.60%  eased 0.4%. Reuters Japan stocks retreat after recent gains, despite an upbeat earnings season. The losses came even as stocks on Wall Street shrugged off a weaker-than-expected U.S. nonfarm payrolls data for July, lifting the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -2.34%  and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index SPX, -2.19%  to fresh record highs on Friday. “The weakness in the [U.S.] employment report ... included a decline in hourly earnings (which may have knock-on effects on income and consumption) and a shorter work week, which depresses output more than the increased number of workers would boost it,” said Brown Brothers Harriman head of currency strategy Marc Chandler. The Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, +0.21%  gained 1%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index HSI, +1.38%  inched up 0.1%. Data released Monday by HSBC put its China’s Services Business Activity Index for July at 51.3, staying above the 50-point threshold that indicates an improvement in activity, and unchanged from the level seen in the June survey. The figure followed a government-sponsored version of the service-sector survey over the weekend, which showed the July non-manufacturing index accelerated to 54.1 from 53.9 in June. “This is another sign that the services sector is stabilizing, and more importantly, is coping with the clampdown on government spending,” said Kim Eng Securities director of sales trading Andrew Sullivan.

The losses outweighed the positive effect from a string of upbeat results for Japanese companies. The Nikkei business daily reported that consolidated pretax profits for the 668 listed companies that have already announced earnings rose an average 42% in the April-to-June quarter compared to the year-earlier period.

TCEHY	HONG KONG (MarketWatch) — Asian stocks rose Thursday after data showing the U.S. economy grew faster than expected and as the Federal Reserve refrained from providing guidance on the scale of its bond purchases. Chinese shares rallied after an official gauge signaled an improvement in the manufacturing sector, while Japanese equities were aided by a string of strong earnings reports, including from two of the nation’s largest banks, as well as from Panasonic Corp. and Tokyo Electric Power Co. TimeShanghai Composite Index15 Jan29 Jan12 Feb5 Mar19 Mar2 Apr CN:SHCOMP 3,200 3,300 3,400 3,500 The Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, +0.24%  jumped 1.8%, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index HSI, +1.42%  rose 0.9% after China’s official manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index unexpectedly rose to 50.3 in July, from 50.1 in June. A reading above 50 indicates an improvement, while one below 50 shows a deterioration in conditions for the sector. The official data differed from the final reading of a separate survey by HSBC, which put China’s PMI for last month at 47.7, an 11-month low. “The increase [in the official PMI reading] didn’t come completely out of the blue. The official index gives a large weight to heavy industry, where there has been other evidence of a turnaround recently,” Capital Economics wrote in a note to clients. Stock gains were spread across a number of sectors in both Shanghai and Hong Kong, and followed reassurances from policy makers on China’s economic growth. Xu Shaoshi, the head of China’s top planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, expressed confidence in a statement Wednesday that the country’s economy will expand at the government’s official target of 7.5% this year. Shares of China Oilfield Services Ltd. 601808, -0.71% CHOLY, -4.27% jumped 5.1%, Haitong Securities Co. 600837, +0.26%  rose 6.5%, and property developer Gemdale Corp. 600383, -0.27%  climbed 3.5% in Shanghai.

While there were no major surprises from the Fed, analysts feel the statement was slightly more dovish,” said IG Markets strategist Stan Shamu. In its statement following a two-day policy meeting, the Fed gave no hint of plans to pare the U.S. central bank’s $85 billion-a-month in asset purchases. Meanwhile, data released Wednesday by the Commerce Department showed the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 1.7% in the second-quarter, beating expectations for a 1% expansion. Australian energy and retail groups advanced, with Woodside Petroleum Ltd. WPL, -0.90% WOPEY, +0.59%  climbing 1.8%, and Wesfarmers Ltd. WES, +0.79% WFAFF, -2.23%  rising 0.4%.

TCEHY	HONG KONG (MarketWatch) — Asian stock markets rose Monday after data showed China’s economy grew in line with expectations in the second quarter, belying some fears of a sharper slowdown. The Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, +0.26%  climbed 1% and the Shenzhen Composite soared 2.3% to front the region’s stock advances, after data from the National Bureau of Statistics put the quarterly gross domestic product growth at 7.5%. Other economic data released Monday also helped ease some worries, with June retail sales, in particular, rising a better-than-expected 13.3%. The GDP growth figure — although weaker than the 7.7% expansion recorded in the first quarter — matched expectations in separate surveys of economists by Dow Jones Newswires and Reuters. Shutterstock China’s economic data prompt a relief rally in Shanghai, boosting other markets. The data followed a period of intense debate over the growth trajectory, as analysts worried that the Chinese economy may face more headwinds as Beijing refrained from providing additional fiscal or monetary stimulus. “After all the conjecture over the weekend, the latest batch of Chinese economic data was largely in line with economist forecasts,” said CommSec economist Savanth Sebastian. “The good news is that retail sales lifted for the fifth consecutive month, and while not at heady 15%-plus growth rates seen a year ago, it still provides a degree of encouragement,” Sebastian said. The gains in Shanghai also came after China’s Xinhua news service — which had late last week cited Finance Minister Lou Jiwei as tipping 7% growth for 2013 — corrected its story over the weekend. The corrected report said the minister had actually indicated the economy would expand 7.5% this year, in line with the government’s official target. Elsewhere, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index HSI, +1.51%   and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 XJO, +0.35%  inched up 0.1% each, while South Korea’s Kospi SEU, +0.60%  added 0.3%, with all three of them erasing earlier losses in the wake of the Chinese data.

TCEHY	HONG KONG (MarketWatch) — Australian stocks declined, and Hong Kong equities snapped a three-day winning run on Tuesday, weighed by overnight losses on Wall Street and uncertainty over U.S. monetary policy. Japanese and mainland Chinese shares overcame choppy trade to finish higher, meanwhile, with a weakened yen helping the Nikkei Stock Average set a fresh multiyear high. The S&P/ASX 200 XJO, +0.35%  dropped 0.6% in Sydney, the Hang Seng Index HSI, +1.53%  gave up 0.5% in Hong Kong and the Kospi SEU, +0.60%  was off 0.1% in Seoul. Japan’s Nikkei NIK, +0.51%  changed direction a few times before rising 0.1% to 15,381.02, its highest finish since December 2007. The benchmark is now up 11% so far in May, and almost 48% higher from the level at last year’s end. The Shanghai Composite 000001, +1.38% inched up 0.2%. Reuters “While there is a strong argument among investors that stocks are due for a pullback, any signs of weaknesses in equities are very quickly used as a buying opportunity,” said Rivkin Securities global analyst Tim Radford. “So until we see any indication of the Federal Reserve tapering stimulus, modest pullbacks of 1%-3% will likely continue to be used as buying opportunities by market participants riding high on a stimulus-driven market,” he said. Trading in most markets was choppy after U.S. stocks reversed course from a record-setting run to end lower Monday, as investors remained focused on how long the Federal Reserve will maintain its asset buying — a key source of stimulus for global equities over the past several months. Caution prevailed ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke’s testimony before lawmakers Wednesday, even as Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans on Monday voiced support for the central bank’s accommodative policies, saying the economy still faced headwinds. The Next 24: Eyes on Home Depot, JPM Stock movers Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. 1398, +0.90% IDCBY, -3.81%  fell 2.1% to weigh on the Hong Kong market, after Goldman Sachs GS, -2.28%  sold its remaining stake in the giant Chinese bank for about $1.12 billion.

TCEHY	HONG KONG (MarketWatch) — Most Asian markets rose Thursday after key U.S. indexes clinched another record finish overnight, although Japanese stocks skidded as a firmer yen led investors to lock in recent gains despite strong economic growth data and upbeat results from banks. The Shanghai Composite 000001, +1.38% climbed 1.2%, Taiwan’s Taiex Y9999, +0.67%  gained 0.9%,South Korea’s Kospi SEU, +0.60%  added 0.8%, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index HSI, +1.46% rose 0.2%. On the downside, Japan’s Nikkei Stock Average NIK, +0.51% dropped 0.4% to 15,037.24, managing to finish above the 15,000-point level. The benchmark had on Wednesday ended above 15,000 for the first time in more than five years. Meanwhile, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 XJO, +0.35% fell 0.5% as commodity stocks weakened. Reuters The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -2.34% rallied higher Thursday to end at its 20th record level so far in 2013. But while the continuing rally in U.S. stocks aided sentiment, weak economic growth in the euro zone and sluggish commodity prices kept buyers in check after strong gains for several regional benchmarks so far in May and this year. DJIA futures were on Thursday down 13 points, or 0.1%, pointing to a likely lower start on Wall Street. Concerns about slowing growth in Asia was also in focus. Sanjay Mathur, Royal Bank of Scotland’s Asia-Pacific head of economic research, said growth in the region excluding Japan has “taken a turn for the worse” of late, in terms of gross domestic product growth, exports and manufacturing indicators. “Overall, we believe that recovery is likely to take its own course and be moderate given the absence of either strong global demand or fresh policy stimuli. This should ensure a period of low inflation and pressure on corporate [profit] margins,” Mathur said. Stock gains in Hong Kong were led by heavyweight HSBC Holdings PLC 0005, +1.64% US:HBC  which climbed 1% a day after it unveiled a plan to cut costs by up to $3 billion by 2016. The bank is planning to cut as many as 14,000 jobs across the world. Shares of Internet services major Tencent Holdings Ltd. 0700, +1.48% TCEHY, -2.58%  jumped 6.5% after the company announced strong growth in quarterly profit. Those gains help offset losses in the energy sector as a strengthening dollar weakened the outlook for prices of commodities, including crude oil. The Next 24: Watch the Yen, and More Shares of PetroChina Co. 0857, +0.19% PTR, -2.37%  lost 2.1% and Cnooc Ltd. 0883, +1.07% CEO, -0.74%  shed 1.4%. Commodity producers also lost ground in other regional markets, weighing in particular on Australia, where BHP Billiton Ltd. BHP, -1.89% BHP, +0.07% dropped 0.8%, gold miner Newcrest Mining Ltd. NCM, +0.41% NCMGY, +0.33%  tumbled 5.3% and Oil Search Ltd. OSH, +0.00% OISHY, +2.26%  lost 0.8%. A weakened Australian dollar AUDUSD, +0.1960% which recently fell below parity against the U.S. currency, also damped sentiment. “A falling Australian dollar may put pressure on offshore investors to sell Australian dollar-denominated assets, as they look to preserve gains from a strengthening equity market,” said Tim Radford, a global analyst at Rivkin Securities. In Tokyo, meanwhile, the drop came despite data released earlier in the day showing the Japanese economy expanded at a better-than-expected rate of 0.9% in the January to March period from the quarter ended Dec. 31. Banking stocks led the drop even after the country’s three largest banks posted strong results, with the Nikkei newspaper reporting that their combined net profit for the fiscal year ended March 31 climbed 11% due to increased lending and upbeat stock and bond markets. Shares of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. 8316, +0.93% SMFG, -1.43%  dropped 4%, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. 8306, +1.33% US:MTU  lost 3.6% and Mizuho Financial Group Inc. 8411, +1.21% MFG, -1.39%  shed 3.1%.

TCEHY	"BEIJING--Tencent Holdings Ltd. (0700.HK), China's largest listed Internet company, said Wednesday that its first-quarter net profit rose 37% on strong revenue growth from online games. The company has in recent quarters buffeted a slowdown in ad spending in China with its diverse Web services, such as online games and e-commerce. With its popular mobile messaging application WeChat, Tencent is well positioned to attract users as more Chinese turn to smartphones to access the Internet, according to analysts. At the end of March, Tencent said WeChat had 194 million monthly active users, up 23.1% from 157.9 million at the end of December 2012. Net profit for the three months ended March 31 rose to 4.04 billion yuan ($650.9 million) from 2.95 billion yuan a year earlier. The result was higher than the average 3.87 billion yuan in net profit for the quarter forecast in a Thomson Reuters' poll of 10 analysts. The jump in profit was in particular driven by revenue from online games, which jumped to 7.13 billion yuan from 5.32 billion yuan in the same period a year earlier. E-commerce revenue also rose more than expected, jumping 154% to 1.91 billion yuan in the first quarter from the same period a year earlier. Despite the strong performance in online games, some analysts have warned that Tencent faces a likely slowdown in its core PC gaming business as Chinese players gradually switch to playing games on smartphones. Though mobile games are the most commercialized aspect of the applications market, many companies including Tencent have yet to cobble together a strong revenue stream from the games. Revenue rose 40.4% to 13.55 billion yuan from 9.65 billion yuan a year earlier, driven primarily by gaming returns and burgeoning e-commerce operations. As concerns have risen in recent years about the slowdown in growth of online advertising and gaming revenue growth, Tencent has been investing in its e-commerce operations. Although well behind e-commerce leader Alibaba Group in terms of market share, the company has said it will invest $1 billion in the coming years as it seeks to enter one of the few parts of the Chinese Internet industry that is still expected to grow rapidly. Tencent operates online games like ""League of Legends"" as well as instant-messaging service QQ, games portal QQ Games and social-networking site Qzone.

TCEHY	"--Initial investment valued at $586 million --Stake could climb to 30% --Deal comes as Sina faces pressure from rivals (Adds fresh stock quote, analyst comment, background on Sina.) Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. revealed plans to spend $586 million to buy a roughly 18% stake in Sina Corp.'s SINA, -2.65% Weibo social media service, jolting the publicly traded Internet company's shares after two years of decline. Sina said the investment in Weibo, a microblogging service often compared with Twitter in the U.S., could climb to 30% under the agreement, which a person familiar with both companies' thinking likened to a joint venture. Sina's shares surged 15% Monday to $57.74, their highest level since October. The stock, which hit an all-time high at $147.12 in 2011, has languished for the past year as the media company struggles to generate more revenue from its growing base of registered users. Both companies Monday said they will partner to connect users' accounts, trade data and coordinate online payments. The agreement also offers Alibaba's collection of e-commerce sites a new ""venue for public exposure,"" said Echo He, an analyst at Maxim Group. ""Definitely this alliance will help Sina on the revenue side, but it's longer term,"" she said. Sina said the alliance should generate about $380 million of revenue from advertising and social commerce services for Weibo over the next three years. Weibo remains Sina's most promising business, with a growing base of 46.2 million active users at the end of last year. Ms. He estimated Alibaba's latest investment values Sina at about $60 a share, a 19% premium to its Thursday close. Sina has struggled with rising costs, however, and competition from rivals such as Weixin, a mobile chat service from Tencent Holdings Ltd. (0700.HK). Sina last year generated $529.3 million of revenue, about $66 million of which came from Weibo. The Web portal only started placing ads on Weibo in earnest during the second half of 2012. On Monday, Sina Chief Executive Charles Chao said the partnership ""will play a vital role in building an eco-system around Weibo's open platform.""

TCEHY	"BEIJING--China Mobile Ltd. CHL, +0.31% said Monday that its first-quarter net profit growth slowed as intensifying competition and growing sales of low-cost smartphones hurt profitability. The slower rate of growth comes as the world's largest mobile carrier, with more than 700 million customers, is plowing almost $7 billion this year into building a new fourth-generation network as it fights to retain supremacy. In the first quarter, the company faced ""unprecedentedly intense market competition and more apparent substitution of traditional communication business by new technologies and new businesses,"" China Mobile Chairman Xi Guohua said in a statement. Though China Mobile is far and away China's largest carrier, profit growth has slowed in part because the company was saddled with a proprietary third-generation Chinese standard not commonly used outside the country. Among other problems, that left China Mobile unable to offer popular phones like Apple Inc.'s AAPL, -2.56% iPhone. As Chinese consumers have rushed to buy touch-screen smartphones that run on 3G networks, they have increasingly bought services from rivals China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. CHU, +0.47% and China Telecom Corp. CHA, -0.92% It has also been hampered by a surge in the use of applications on smartphones, which has hit revenue growth from traditional text and voice services. Applications like Tencent Holdings Ltd.'s (0700.HK) WeChat allow users to send voice and text messages free of charge, leading many users to make fewer phone calls and send fewer traditional text messages. Net profit for the three months ended March 31 rose to CNY27.9 billion from CNY27.8 billion a year earlier. China Mobile's first-quarter operating revenue rose 5.7% to CNY134.7 billion from CNY127.5 billion a year earlier. Although China Mobile has attracted more users to its third-generation services recently, analyst Victor Yip with UOBKayHian said in a note that it hasn't helped much to lift average revenue per user--a key metric for carriers. In the first quarter, average revenue per user fell to CNY63 from CNY65 in the same period a year earlier. This is in part why China Mobile has been working to sign a deal with Apple to offer the iPhone. In January, Chairman Xi Guohua met Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook in Beijing and discussed cooperation, raising expectations that the carrier would soon begin offering the iPhone. China Mobile would be a key partner for Apple, which faces fierce competition from Samsung Electronics Co. (005930.SE) and other rivals offering smartphones powered by Google Inc.'s GOOG, -2.02% Android operating system. Since then, the company has said it has no further updates on the talks with Apple.

TCEHY	BEIJING--Tencent Holdings Ltd. (0700.HK) Chief Executive Pony Ma said Tuesday that the company would begin commercializing its popular messaging application WeChat in China in the coming months. Although WeChat has garnered more than 300 million downloads since its launch about two years ago, analysts have focused on when the company will begin to make money off the application. Speaking on the sidelines of the opening session of the National People's Congress, the nation's parliament, Mr. Ma said the company would begin introducing mobile social games on the application in the coming months to commercialize WeChat. He added that the company would also begin to introduce micropayments for services like taxis on the application during the same period. Tencent has also been pushing to grow the application abroad, Mr. Ma said, pointing out that the company would speed up its international strategy as competition heats up from rival messaging application Line. He said the company recently opened an office in the U.S. to support WeChat as part of that effort. Mr. Ma also said that one of the biggest problems facing the Internet industry in China has been the slow spread of faster third-generation mobile services. Pointing out that rapid expansion of 3G equipment has become too costly for carriers, he said the government should invest more in 3G services. He also said Tencent was still open to acquisitions, adding that the company is particularly interested in investing in smaller U.S. startups.

TCEHY	BEIJING (Caixin Online) — Flames of a public relations disaster were licking at the heels of a private equity firm when China’s most notorious Internet-scrubbing company rode to the rescue. Saving the Shenzhen-based firm’s image wasn’t cheap, and it took more than two months to douse the flames of Internet news reports and rumors claiming executives had used a Ponzi scheme to bilk investors. From a technical standpoint, however, deleting every image-stinging accusation was relatively easy for a team of public relations specialists at Yage Time Advertising Ltd., which for a price deleted Internet postings of all kinds according to client specifications before a police crackdown on Internet scrubbing last year.  ABOUT CAIXIN Caixin is a Beijing-based media group dedicated to providing high-quality and authoritative financial and business news and information through periodicals, online and TV/video programs. • Get the Caixin e-newsletter The company’s founder, 30-year-old Gu Dengda, is awaiting trial on a variety of charges including bribery. He’s one of at least 10 Internet clean-up specialists currently being detained by police. And Yage is one of several companies closed over the past year by authorities for turning China’s website administration process into an illegal money machine. The last vestiges of China’s web-scrubbing industry were apparently wiped out in July when police raids targeted Yage and a related public relations firm in Beijing’s Haidian District. More than 100 employees — even janitors — were detained. Authorities were so determined to leave no stone unturned that every uniformed officer in the district was dispatched for the raids, even a forensic examiner. Shutterstock The Haidian clampdown had its roots in a national campaign launched three months earlier by four central government agencies — the Propaganda Department of the Communist Party’s Central Committee, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Public Security, and the State Administration for Industry & Commerce — aimed at uprooting website administrator bribery and other illegal, Internet-related public relations activity. Targets included employees at public relations firms, major news portals such as Netease and Sohu, the Beijing-area news portal Qianlong, Internet search giant Baidu and local government Internet regulators. A primary goal was to finally stop the moneymaking scheme that Gu started and Yage perfected before being imitated by other businesses across the country. His and other businesses rescued companies from image-damaging content on the Internet by paying website operators to delete posts and news articles. They would also arrange to beef up online reputations for companies and government officials. Most of those detained during the Haidian raids were caught by surprise. While under interrogation, police said, several shook their heads “no” after being asked whether they knew that deleting web posts was against the law. Wealth track Gu, whose name in Chinese means “reaching prosperity,” found a shortcut to fortune in 2006 after learning how website operations work as a low-level staffer at China’s largest search engine Baidu. Why China Is Worth the Investment He decided money could be made based on the fact that at that time Internet users were posting more than 2 million messages on Baidu’s public forums every day. In addition, news and information website readers were posting massive numbers of reader comments. By deleting postings and comments that painted a negative picture of a company or individual, Gu decided he could make a decent living. Gu’s knowledge of Baidu’s website-user rules worked to his advantage. He knew, for example, that the search engine’s around-the-clock complaint department would work with website technicians to quickly remove any posts about which they received a Baidu-user complaint. At that time, blog posts, comments and other data could be scrubbed based entirely on a single complaint. Moreover, Gu knew how to make direct contact with website administrators and their colleagues. This skill — coupled with his ability to grease palms and cultivate good relations with website staffers — proved to be the key to his business success. Gu started by charging 800 to 1,000 yuan ($128 to $160) per deleted post while still employed at Baidu. He would start working his magic after finding an image-conscious customer, who wanted something scrubbed from the Internet. He would then file complaints with Baidu BIDU, -2.55% about relevant postings, and watch the Web until they disappeared.  • MarketWatch Topics: Middle East • | | • | | • U.S.: |  TOOLS • Latin American and Canadian indexes • European indexes | Asian indexes  MORE ON THE MARKETS • Global Economic Calendar • | | Earnings Watch • | U.S. Economic Calendar A former Yage colleague said his boss managed to pocket tens of thousands of yuan USDCNY, +0.2014%  during this moonlighting phase, before launching his company. Gu once told employees at Yage ‘s that “traditional crisis management skills are public apologies and paying compensation to victims. But what’s needed by those companies that want to get listed (on the stock market), or those that don’t want to spend much to manage a crisis, is to prevent the spread of (negative) information. “This is especially true for local government officials and entertainment stars,” Gu told his staff, according to the former Yage employee. Gu’s sideline business took off, so he quit Baidu in 2007 and set up Beijng Yage Time Technology Ltd. He later changed its name to Yage Time Advertising and registered the firm under the name of his wife, the chief financial officer. Yage’s clients ranged from small, private companies to heavyweights such as China Mobile 0941, +2.38% CHL, +0.31%  and FAW-Volkswagen, the joint venture set up by German carmaker Volkswagen and Chinese counterpart First Automobile Works 000800, -0.39% Foreign concerns, including Pizza Hut and the Japanese restaurant chain Yoshinoya, also hired Yage. But Yage’s best clients were local government officials. They were generally eager to pay for his help with building a positive image and a clean record on the Internet. A former Yage staff member said about 60% of the company’s profits came from business with officials from second- and third-tier cities. These clients included many police chiefs. As part of Gu’s strategy, dozens of Yage staffers spent the workday surfing the Internet in search of negative news, comments and postings about government officials. Any official whose reputation seemed to be threatened would be contacted and offered Yage’s services as soon as negative information surfaced online. High season for Yage’s business with local government clients was usually just before the National People’s Congress and China People’s Political Consultative Conference held every March in Beijing. It’s around conference time that officials typically come under attack from whistleblowers. It’s also when these officials are often willing to pay a premium to see negative publicity vanish. A former Yage staffer recalled that Gu once announced at an internal meeting that a deal with a nervous government official was worth no less than 500,000 yuan. Yage’s cream of the crop employees built good client relations with government officials. These included a dozen hand-picked by Gu and carefully trained so they could successfully pitch the company’s services to even high-ranking officials. Gu also found ways to profit from value-added services. For example, after scrubbing negative content for a client, Yage sales staffers often recommended Internet surveillance software that could be used to self-monitor web forums. Yage could buy a single software license for 100,000 yuan and sell it to a gullible client for 400,000 yuan. Who deletes At the other end of the food chain were website operators and administrators — and in some cases government-linked Internet censors — with the power to delete information after it was posted on the Internet. Gu and others at Yage cultivated personal relationships with front-line website operators, mainly by wining and dining but sometimes by offering a bribe, in exchange for having certain posts deleted. In 2009, web forum operators and other public relations companies started adopting a similar business model by arranging to delete online information for fees. A website administrator’s fee for cutting a single website post could cost hundreds of yuan. And a public relations company that worked as a mediator between a website administrator and a customer could charge thousands of yuan per scrubbed post. Soon, an entire industry emerged with standard pricing for deletions and related services. Google Shares Top $800, Giant Eyes Retail Push The Shenzhen private equity firm paid Yage 1 million yuan to have all negative publicity erased from the Internet, said a former Yage employee. Ten Yage staffers accomplished the task by tracking down every relevant media outlet and having each delete negative news articles about the firm, one by one. They also got news aggregators and web forum operators to remove re-posted pieces. Yage staffers used any means at hand to get the job done. In the end, the former Yage employee said, the company profited heavily after handing out a mere 10,000 yuan in payoffs in exchange for cooperation from website administrators and media site editors. Gu also found a way to exploit the rules of the road on China’s Internet in ways that saved time and money: He got websites with which he had no direct contact to clean up re-postings about Yage clients simply by presenting a formal letter from the company or its public relations firm saying that the original publisher had altered a particular news item. Another Yage secret to success was its ability to get search engine administrators, including some at Baidu, to tweak key word filtering so that a search using that word would show none of the articles in which it appears. A former Yage employee told Caixin the company used to be able to take advantage of personal connections at Baidu to have certain words filtered for clients. But nothing worked better than building good, personal relations with the website editors and operators, who are allowed to have their fingers on the delete button. These relations were further stoked via social networks, whose members worked for Yage and similar companies. Major Internet companies started taking note of the scrubbing activity, prompting some to tighten rules. Major news portals such as Sina SINA, -2.65% Tencent 0700, +1.43% TCEHY, -2.58%  and Netease NTES, -1.92% as well as niche sites such as Hexun, started to more closely scrutinize the editing process that follows web post publishing. Any unauthorized deletion of website information at these companies could cost a person his or her job. News website operators maintain regular contact with Beijing city government officials at the Internet Management Office. All parties hold a regular meeting every Friday, and through the course of each week officials use phone calls or text messages to convey specific orders, including any orders to filter out key words from search functions. Officials close to the Haidian police probe and raid told Caixin that some government officials use these official order channels for personal benefits. Indeed, last year police arrested a staff from Beijing’s Internet Management Office for alleged bribery. Also during last year’s clampdown, two Netease employees were arrested for allegedly accepting bribes. And four Baidu employees were arrested on similar charges. Among those rounded up at Baidu was a man surnamed Xu, who authorities said deleted 76 posts on the night of May 29, charging 300 yuan per scrub. He kept 70% of that money and handed over 30% to a mediator. Protests Across Asia Urge Environmental Controls Xu was fired after Baidu’s internal controls detected unusually large numbers of website post deletions. He was arrested in July. Black listing Arrested with Gu was Hu Chunyu, the financial news channel chief at Qianlong 1236, -1.65% a website tied to state-run media including the Beijing Daily newspaper, the Beijing Radio Station and Beijing TV. The site is managed by the Propaganda Department at the Beijing Municipality’s Communist Party Committee. Hu’s fall followed a three-year effort at Qianlong to improve the company’s bottom line by allowing Yage to carry out public relations projects. These projects involved public relations companies that would produce or re-post pieces that smeared companies or at least threatened their reputations, have them posted on Qianlong, and later have the pieces removed after the targeted company paid a fee. A few years after its founding in 2000, Qianlong started outsourcing part of its news production to public relations companies. In 2009, Yage won a more than 100,000 yuan-a-year contract to supply business channel content. Yage also won the right to post and delete articles on that web page. Yage at first posted advertorials disguised as news. Later, the Qianlong business site started a “Company Black List” section with hundreds of negative reports about various firms beside an advertisement offering Yage’s Internet firefighting services. Several companies like Yage also won access to the website and started their own means of extortion. A manager at an education company told Caixin his company once paid Yage to delete a negative news piece appearing on Qianlong, but then had to pay another public relations company after the same news appeared elsewhere on the website. “You can’t stop negative news on Qianlong,” said a communications officer at an e-commerce company. “Once you (pay) to have a piece removed, they’ll see you as having deep pockets and come back again and again. “We think Qianlong is shameless,” the source said. “But you really can’t cross it. It’s still one of the Beijing government’s official propaganda portals.” So far, Hu has been the only target of the police probe into Qianlong. Coincidentally, he has a relative who works for the Beijing government’s Internet office. Web-data deleting first turned heads in 2010, when state-run CCTV television broadcast an investigative report about Yage and its dark deals. But authorities took no action. In fact, Yage’s business surged after the broadcast, because it taught companies and government officials that they could actually buy a positive online image. That same year, Gu set up another public relations company called Xinxun Media Ltd., which focused on advertorials and charged clients for positive news spinning. Yage continued to function as a cash cow. An industry insider told Caixin Yage’s 2011 revenues exceeded 50 million yuan. Xinxun and Yage shared an office, and the former relied on the latter to provide clients. Whenever speaking in public, though, Gu identified himself as a Xinxun executive. The Haidian police raid targeted Xinxun as well as Yage. Employees from each company were detained. No dates have been announced for court hearings. Meanwhile, despite the crackdown, nothing has changed about the online image of what may be China’s most successful Internet scrubber. A Baidu search for “Yage” still yields a list of websites that carry the company’s advertisements and slogans such as “Yage Time professionals help you delete negative reports” and “key word filtering: a solution to anything negative.” Read this report on Caixin Online.

TCEHY	BEIJING (Caixin Online) — Chinese mobile game operators like Guangzhou Gude Network Technology Co. had reason to cheer in 2012, as it and many other industry players enjoyed rapid growth. Gude Chairman Xu Yuan called the year a turning point for companies in the industry. Gude’s role playing game, World Online, had monthly revenue of 18 million yuan ($2.9 million) and average revenue per user of 300 yuan USDCNY, +0.1967% Additionally, a number of mobile game companies, who only a few years ago seldom saw monthly revenue of 1 million yuan, last year broke the 10 million mark, Xu said. Xue Yongfeng, an analyst at industry information provider Analysys International, said the future for the industry was bright. “The mobile game market has figured out a clear business model, and the industry chain is quite complete. Business is ready to boom.”  ABOUT CAIXIN Caixin is a Beijing-based media group dedicated to providing high-quality and authoritative financial and business news and information through periodicals, online and TV/video programs. • Get the Caixin e-newsletter Xue expected more companies and investors to enter the field in 2013, meaning “China’s mobile game industry may see a revolutionary change.” Song Wei, secretary general of Global Mobile Game Confederation, a Sichuan-based industry association whose members include Angry Bird developer Rovio Entertainment, Fruit Ninja maker Halfbrick Studios and Gude, predicted that some popular mobile games will have monthly revenue of more than 100 million yuan. The Android approach Mobile games on the Android operation system have posted strong profits, said Zhu Shunyan, CEO of UCWeb Inc., a mobile internet software provider. “The growth is astonishing,” Zhu said. UCWeb said 10 Android-based games have had average monthly revenue of more than 1 million yuan in 2012, compared to four in late 2011. Three games operating on the Android system pocketed more than 10 million yuan every month in 2012. Gude’s World Online was the first to reach 10 million yuan in monthly revenue. The game, launched in September 2011, had revenue of 2 million yuan in its first month, Xu said. Compared to PC games, the versions for mobile devices require far fewer resources. The team that developed World Online had only 27 people. By the end of 2012, Gude employed only 88 people. Xu attributed his company’s success to a strategy that focused on developing a more complicated game for the Android system. The Future, According to Eric Schmidt “(We) believed the Android system had promising growth potential, while PC games have cultivated a large number of users who like to play complicated games,” said Xu. World Online’s success was repeated by Wangxian, another Android-based mobile game. On its first day of operation in June, Wangxian had income of more than 100,000 yuan. In September, Wangxian’s revenue reached 10 million yuan. Next player Many of the companies who entered the mobile game industry have earned their first fortune, attracting an increasing number of market players and investors to the booming market. Xu said more and more PC game developers and other newcomers have joined the fray. Zhu Yanshun, a senior executive of Beijing Ourpalm Co., said traditional PC game developers, like Shanda Games Ltd. US:GAME  and Perfect World Co. US:PWRD plan to develop games for mobile devices. Shenzhen-listed Ourpalm 300315, +0.00%  was one of the earliest Java mobile game developers in the country. It had revenue of 183 million yuan in 2011 and net profit of 55.7 million yuan. Ourpalm started develop smart phone games in October 2011, and by the end of the year games based on the iOS and Android systems generated 530,000 yuan in revenue for the company, Zhang said. Internet veterans like Baidu BIDU, -2.55% Qihoo360 US:QIHU  and UCWeb were also building platforms offering mobile games, and telecom operators are also counting on mobile game business. Gude’s Xu says the company is in talks with smart phone markers Huawei Technologies Co., ZTE Corporation 0763, +6.58% ZTCOY, -3.73% and Lenovo LNVGY, -2.69% 0992, +1.24%  to install its game on their handsets and share the revenue. The booming sector was also attracting capital. Li Juhua, investment manager of Zhejiang Zheshang Venture Capital Co., said many companies like his planned to invest in mobile gaming in 2012. His company has found an investment target, he said. Research firm Zero2IPO said 30 investments were made in China’s Internet industry in the first half 2012, including seven in the mobile game business. Li Mimi, Asia-Pacific manager of Intel Capital, Intel Corp.’s INTC, -3.16% global investment and mergers-and-acquisitions arm, expected both the number and value of investments to rise in 2013, and added that Intel was seeking an investment target. Bright future Wang Feng, the chief executive of Web-based game developer linekong.com, said the rise of smart phone games would change Internet gaming. Traditional platform providers like the telecom operators and Tencent 0700, +1.43% TCEHY, -2.58%  would face stronger competition from newcomers like Baidu and UCWeb. Since launching its mobile game platform in May 2011, UCWeb has been catching up with Tencent, China Mobile 0941, +2.38% CHL, +0.31% and China Telecom CHA, -0.92% 0728, +1.16%  becoming the fourth largest mobile phone game operator with market share of 6.2%. In 2012, game developers earned more than 100 million yuan from their operations on UCWeb. Tencent is facing more and more challenges. The head of its wireless game service, Li Ying, said in late 2012 that the gap between it and its rivals was narrowing.  • MarketWatch Topics: Middle East • | | • | | • U.S.: |  TOOLS • Latin American and Canadian indexes • European indexes | Asian indexes  MORE ON THE MARKETS • Global Economic Calendar • | | Earnings Watch • | U.S. Economic Calendar Telecom operators are also facing greater challenges. Development of online payment systems weakened telecom operators’ advantage and created more choice for game players, Xu said. A source at China Telecom said that “in the future, telecom operators, Internet companies and mobile game developers will all provide game platforms and compete for good games and users. All of them will have to make efforts on services and marketing,” said a source from China Telecom. All of the changes mean game developers now have more choice regarding where to launch their products. Zhu said platforms are luring popular game developers by offering higher revenue sharing, ranging from 50% to 70%. However, Zhang said that nether platform operators nor game developers had a dominant say in the market. The two sides had to work together to win customers. Meanwhile, the country’s mobile game market was becoming a battlefield for a large number of small developers. Analysys International said the largest player, Tencent, now controls about 22% of the mobile game market, followed by Gude and WiSTONE Entertainment, with 5.7% and 5.3%, respectively. Due to much lower requirements for capital, talent and time compared to traditional PC games, there are no exact figures on how many mobile game developers are operating in the country. Industry insiders say many teams involve only ten to twenty people, and many have failed. Zhu estimated that only 30% of mobile game developers were profitable, “earning from several hundred thousand yuan to millions of yuan.” However, with Analysys International predicting that China’s smart phone penetration rate would reach 50% in 2013, the boom looks set to continue. The company forecast 55% growth of mobile game revenue to 9.6 billion yuan this year, and says annual growth will remain above 50% until 2015. Read this report on Caixin Online.

TCEHY	HONG KONG (MarketWatch) — Politics worked to split stock performance in Asia on Thursday, with Tokyo shares getting a lift from expectations for new elections and stepped up calls for more aggressive easing by Japan’s central bank, while China’s leadership change did little to boost shares. Japan’s Nikkei Stock Average NIK, +0.51%  gained 1.9% to end at a one-week high, the sole gainer among the region’s leading stock indexes. The Asia Dow was down 0.8%. South Korea’s Kospi SEU, +0.60%  fell 1.2%, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 index XJO, +0.35%  retreated 0.9% and Taiwan’s Taiex was down 0.2%. Reuters China's new leaders. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index HSI, +1.36%  dropped 1.6%, while the Shanghai Composite Index 000001, +1.38%  lost 1.2%, showing little reaction after China unveiled the makeup of its top Communist Party leadership body Thursday. The losses outside of Japan followed a sharp drop Wednesday on Wall Street, as renewed tension in the Mideast and worries about the U.S. “fiscal cliff” of potential tax hikes and spending cuts kept investors on edge. U.S. President Barack Obama reiterated in a news conference Wednesday that taxes on the wealthy must go up. Obama is set to meet with congressional leaders on Friday to discuss the country’s fiscal situation. See: MarketWatch’s full coverage of the fiscal cliff. The dollar USDJPY, +0.12%  rose firmly above 80 yen (about $1) overnight — and had climbed to ¥80.81 by Thursday afternoon — amid speculation that the country is close to an election that could propel opposition leader Shinzo Abe, a monetary dove, to become the next prime minister. Likewise, the euro EURJPY, -0.02%  rose above the ¥102 level overnight, and then breached the ¥103 level during Asian trade. Read: Dollar reverses loss after Obama speaks. Obama Comments on Fiscal Cliff at Press Conference “The dollar/yen remains better bid amid expectations that parliament will be dissolved tomorrow for snap elections on Dec. 16,” said Sue Trinh, a strategist at RBC Capital Markets. The Japanese opposition’s Abe on Thursday urged the Bank of Japan to pursue aggressive monetary reflation. He called for the central bank to adopt an inflation target in the 2%-3% range, urging unlimited liquidity provisions in order to meet the CPI target. Abe also said he would push to amend the law so that the policy board of the Bank of Japan would be obligated to meet official inflation targets. Credit Suisse said Abe was seeking to garner support from small business for a snap election. The research house also cast doubt that plans to ramp up money printing operations would help the economy, warning that “inflation amid devaluation of the yen is likely to dampen real private consumption and hence to widen the negative output gap.” In Tokyo, consumer electronics giant Sony Corp. 6758, +0.29% SNE, -1.44%  tumbled 8.9% after the global conglomerate announced after Wednesday’s close that it plans to issue the equivalent of about $1.85 billion in convertible bonds.

TCEHY	"--Tencent third-quarter net profit rises 32% on gaming, advertising revenue growth --Tencent warns growth of advertising revenue could slow --Tencent's online gaming revenue more than doubled from a year earlier (Recasts lead, adds background, advertising revenue detail in third and fourth paragraphs, gaming business details in sixth and seventh paragraphs) BEIJING--Chinese internet company Tencent Holdings Ltd. (0700.HK) said Wednesday its third-quarter net profit rose 32%, slightly missing analyst projections, but bucking the trend of deteriorating performance at its rivals, which have been hurt by a slowdown in online advertising. Smaller Chinese Internet firms have suffered due to continuing economic weakness in China, competition and as Chinese customers have increasingly switched to accessing the Internet on less advertising-friendly mobile devices. Earlier in the day Renren Inc. reported widening losses as online-advertising sales decreased 14% from a year earlier. In contrast, Tencent posted a 69% jump in online advertising revenue from a year earlier, due to increased advertising during the London Olympics and its performance-based ads, which help advertisers target specific types of consumers and charge only when customers click on the advertisements. ""Looking forward, the absence of the Olympic Games event and decelerating economic growth in China may slow revenue growth rates for the online advertising industry as a whole, including our own online advertising business,"" Tencent warned in its earnings statement. Tencent has in the past used its diverse revenue streams to ride out industry change and macroeconomic weakness, and in the third quarter, it managed to increase revenue from its e-commerce and mobile value-added services. The core of its business, gaming, also performed strongly despite worries from some analysts that game players are turning to casual online games and away from subscription role-playing and first-person shooter games. Its online game revenue more than doubled to CNY8.4 billion ($1.33 billion) in the third quarter compared with CNY4.1 billion in the same period a year earlier. The company attributed the growth to new games such as the Legend of Yulong as well as growing revenue from international markets like the U.S., Europe and South Korea. Net profit for the three months ended Sept. 30 was CNY3.22 billion, up from CNY2.45 billion from a year earlier, the company said. The result was slightly worse than the average CNY3.46 billion net profit forecast of nine analysts polled earlier by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 54% to CNY11.57 billion from CNY7.50 billion, undershooting the average CNY11.62 billion forecast in the poll. Founded in 1998, Tencent first gained an online presence with an instant-messaging platform. Since then, it has used its strength in chat -- in the first quarter about 750 million people used its service at least once a month -- to drive traffic to new products like video games and social-media sites. --Kristin Jones contributed to this article.

TCEHY	Renren Inc.'s RENN, +3.97% third-quarter loss widened as the Chinese social-networking company's operating expenses jumped, offsetting an increase in revenue from online games. The company expects current-quarter revenue between $45 million and $47 million, short of the $51 million estimate from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Renren runs one of the largest social-networking websites in China, as well as a popular daily-deal site, Nuomi. The company has posted mixed bottom-line results since going public last year as increased expenses have frequently masked revenue growth. In the latest quarter, revenue from Internet value-added services more than doubled, thanks in part to the rising popularity of in-house games recently launched by Renren. However, online-advertising sales decreased 14% from a year earlier. Chief Executive Joseph Chen Tuesday blamed a decline in advertising sales on a weak economy and intensifying competition, as well as continued migration of Renren's traffic to mobile devices. Mr. Chen said the company's focus and investments will continue to shift toward the mobile market. The Beijing company has continually warned of intense competition in China's fragmented social-networking market, citing popular micro-blogging sites run by Sina Corp. SINA, -2.65% and Tencent Holdings Ltd. (TCEHY, 0700.HK) and other social-networking sites. Renren posted a loss of $15.4 million, or four cents an American depositary share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $1.2 million, or break-even per ADS. Revenue jumped 47% to $50.4 million. The company's August view called for revenue of $49 million to $51 million. Gross margin narrowed sharply to 61.4% from 80.4%. Operating expenses rose 52% to $51.6 million, as the company invested heavily in sales staff and advertising for Nuomi, and reported higher personnel and promotions for products on Renren. Monthly unique log-in users reached 48 million in September, up 27% from a year earlier. Renren's ADS were down 3.9% in after-hours trading to $3.25. The stock is down 4.8% so far this year.

TCEHY	"Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. TTWO, -4.06% is developing a new version of ""Civilization,"" one of its most storied franchises, featuring interconnected virtual worlds in which players can compete. But it's not for the U.S., its largest market; this game is being developed for South Korea. The New York company--best known for its ""Grand Theft Auto"" and ""Borderlands"" franchises--is the latest of a bevy of large U.S. game companies who are attempting to embrace the fast-growing Asian markets, where gaming consoles like Microsoft Corp.'s MSFT, -2.33% Xbox or Sony Corp.'s (6758.TO, SNE) PlayStation 3 barely have a presence. Instead, gamers there typically play on a PC at home or in one of the many Internet cafes. Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two's chief executive, said he chose to focus on building a ""Civilization"" game for South Korea because strategy-type games--which often ask players to control armies, cities or entire worlds by making decisions such as what to build and where to send troops--are popular in that part of the world. Other strategy games like Activision Blizzard Inc.'s ATVI, -2.96% ""StarCraft"" space-age games have become so popular there that television channels have been devoted to broadcasting professional matches between top players in the games. ""Civilization,"" Mr. Zelnick said, has a strong brand as well and could perform well in South Korea if it is offered in a compelling way. ""There's real untapped demand for it there,"" he said. For Take-Two in particular, ""Civilization"" will be the first of its primary videogame brands to be shifted over to the Asian market. The franchise has been on the market for 21 years and sold more than 11 million copies, mostly in the western world, Take-Two said. ""We haven't really haven't penetrated Asia,"" said David Ismailer, chief operating officer for Take-Two's ""2K Games"" unit, noting that ""Civilization"" has historically been a PC-game, which are regularly copied and pirated in that part in the world. Take-Two hasn't chosen a business model for the game, it said, which has been in development with XLGAMES Inc., a South Korean-based games company. Activision, as well, has partnered with companies such as Tencent Holdings Ltd. (TCEHY, 0700.HK) to bring its brands to the Asian markets, most recently with a version of its popular ""Call of Duty"" war shooting simulation game aimed at China. Take-Two has also partnered with Tencent to bring its popular basketball game franchise, ""NBA 2K,"" to Chinese consumers this week. It also partnered with companies such as Nexon Co. Ltd. (3659.TO) to develop a baseball game. Owen Mahoney, Nexon's chief financial officer, said in a statement that he was happy to be working with Take-Two to create an ""immersive and engaging new experience."" Spokeswomen for Tencent and XLGAMES didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Mr. Zelnick admitted his isn't the first company to make these deals but, he said, Take-Two has learned from the successes and missteps of its competitors, particularly with a focus on ensuring high quality while tweaking the games to local tastes. His goal is also not only growth, but reliable revenue and earnings as well. Ideally, the company would have ""a meaningful part of our business will be less bumpy than our huge console business,"" he said. The opportunity for Take-Two is there, said Yoshio Osaki, a senior vice president at market researcher and consultancy International Development Group. He estimated the South Korean market for videogames represented about $5 billion last year, and the Chinese market represented $6 billion. In addition, he said, the biggest driver of growth for videogames in those regions has been Internet-connected games, including lucrative subscription and free-to-play titles. ""It could be an interesting high-margin revenue opportunity for them,"" he said, though he adds that competitors in the region have more experience. That's why the partnerships are key. ""It's a wise move for Take-Two to work with these local players because they can help navigate the regulatory waters and connect with gamers,"" he said. Take-Two's ambitions in Asia began in 2005, when the company opened its first offices in Shanghai, with about 20 employees mostly handling outsourcing game artwork and making games work on other videogame consoles. Mr. Ismailer said Take-Two began looking for partnerships a couple years later and, by 2009, the company had struck its agreement to bring an NBA game to China. Today, Mr. Ismailer said, Take-Two counts roughly 300 employees in China alone, with other smaller offices dotted in other parts of Asia. Mr. Zelnick said that each deal is structured so that Take-Two's risk is ""de minimis."" But Take-Two is working closely with its partners, the company said, with its development teams making up roughly half of the staff building the games. Many of Take-Two's staff hired overseas are also being brought to the U.S. for training, the company added, to ensure they can produce the same quality of work from the remote studios. This isn't a first step toward Take-Two testing a free-to-play model that could eventually be offered to U.S. consumers though, Mr. Zelnick warned. Instead, he said he is focused on applying business models where they'll fit best. ""We're expanding our relationship with consumers by meeting them wherever they are, whatever device they want to use, with whatever experience they want to have, whatever business model they want to use, wherever they're located,"" he said.

BIDU, -2.55% China's largest search engine by revenue, has released its own mobile Internet browser and said it would invest in a new cloud computing center on Monday in a bid to gain stronger control over how Internet users in China access the web through smartphones. The launch of the browser, which offers speedy download times, Baidu services, and can run applications directly off the Internet, is the most recent step by Baidu to gain a better hold of a still young, but rapidly expanding mobile Internet market. The company has dominated online search in China since U.S.-based Google Inc. said it would stop following Chinese censorship laws and moved its search service to Hong Kong in 2010. But as China's customers increasingly turn to smartphones to access the Internet, users have more often turned to other search engines as well as social networks to surf the web. To counter the trend, Baidu launched an Android-based smartphone operating system in May and has been cooperating with handset makers to feature the software on an increasing number of phones sold in China. Baidu said it hoped to have handset makers pre-install its new browser on 80% of smartphones sold in China by the end of 2012. Although a niche market, Baidu faces competition from rival Tencent Holdings Ltd. (0700.HK), which already had a 16.5% share of the mobile browser market in the first quarter of 2012, according to statistics from Baidu. At its Baidu World conference, the company also said it would invest roughly 10 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) in a cloud computing center. Baidu didn't give further details such as where the center would be located and how it would pay for the investment. The company is offering cloud services such as remote online data storage to users and application developers to woo them to use its mobile services. Baidu also said it would provide new resources, such as access to software based on Baidu's maps, in order to help application developers build products based on Baidu services. A common approach that has also been taken by Tencent, Baidu will look to the developers to improve its services, while developers take advantage of Baidu's popularity to make money from their products. Baidu's mobile browser will also compete with UCWeb, a company that specializes in mobile browsers and held a leading 28.9% share of the market in the first quarter, according to Baidu statistics. In June, a person familiar with the matter said that Baidu was in talks to buy a stake in UCWeb, though there has been no sign the talks were successful. Baidu said its relationship with UCWeb would remain strong despite the launch of its own browser. UCWeb offers Baidu's search services on its browser.

TCEHY	BEIJING (Caixin Online) — China’s titans of online retailing have unsheathed their marketing swords for a war in cyberspace that industry watchers say will decide the future of everyday shopping habits for nearly a billion consumers. Dozens of retail companies have staked out online niches since bargain-hunting, Internet-savvy Chinese consumers started migrating to e-commerce websites from traditional storefronts for certain purchases about a decade ago. The shift began as a trickle but has since become a raging torrent. Online retailing last year was a 800 billion yuan ($126 billion) industry in China, rising 56% from the previous year, according to China e-Business Research Center. About 4% of all basic consumer purchases in China are now made on the Internet.  ABOUT CAIXIN Caixin is a Beijing-based media group dedicated to providing high-quality and authoritative financial and business news and information through periodicals, online and TV/video programs. • Get the Caixin e-newsletter Smack in the center of this vast and widening merchandise landscape is a nucleus of major retail companies that analysts say have amassed huge arsenals in the areas of financing, logistics and advertising capacity. These companies have strengthened their positions and won investor confidence to a point, where they may be able to dominate the business for years to come. Key industry leaders include Suning Appliance Co.’s (002024) newly launched online platform Suning.com, 360buy Jingdong Mall’s site 360buy.com, the Taobao network operated by Alibaba Group, Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s (700)  TCEHY, -2.58%  51buy, and Yihaodian, which in August got a Chinese government green light to cooperate with Wal-Mart Stores WMT, -1.28% The investment community hasn’t entirely lost interest in the smaller warriors of cyber retailing such as clothing merchant Vancl and bookseller Dangdang. But in the eyes of many, the biggest and most fearsome of the bunch have already set a development pace and business standards that the rest, it seems, will have to follow to succeed in China. At the same time, the market leaders are ready to compete head-on with one another and push individual business models — each with unique characteristics and challenges — to the limit over the next year. None of these titans appears satisfied to share the lead. Each seems determined to rise above the rest. The Dangers of Getting Rich in China “The (business) models for online retailers have diverged,” said a private equity investor in e-commerce industry. “We’re looking for which model will pass the test.” Strategic maneuvers Emerging at this stage of the fight for China’s e-commerce crown is a common retail tactic that’s been attracting shoppers since long before the invention of the Internet: price-cutting. Suning, 360buy and home appliance supplier Gome Electrical Appliances Holdings (493), which like Suning has expanded into cyberspace from a traditional chain-store base, have separately promised to sell products at cost to online customers at least through late 2012. A company shareholder of Suning said in July the company would launch in the following month a nationwide “a zero gross profit” sales promotion. The campaign was slated to cover storefronts and the company’s online mall. The promotion’s chief aim was to lure online consumers away from rival 360Buy, the Suning source said. But 360Buy got a jump on Suning during the first half of the year, when it overwhelmed competitors during what a private equity source called a “fierce” price war for products such as TVs and computers. Despite cutting prices, the source said, “360Buy.com was still able to grow faster than other online retailers” during that battle for shoppers. A microblog posting in mid-August by Liu Qiangdong, chief executive of 360buy’s parent company, pledged another round of price-cutting this fall as part of a bid to beat back Suning and Gome, which has similarly promised to slash prices to the bone. Online retailers have also written fund-raising and large-scale capital spending into their tactical plans. To prove his company’s willingness to take financial risks, for example, Suning Chairman Zhang Jindong used his company equity as mortgage to support Suning’s largest fundraising — 4.7 billion yuan to finance its strategy to fully transit into an e-commerce company. The company reported 94 billion yuan in revenues last year, including store and online sales. Shenzhen-listed Suning has a market capitalization of 46 billion yuan in mid-August. 360Buy is believed to be exploring options for an initial public offering despite executives saying the company will not go pubic no earlier than 2013. Alibaba, on the other hand, has privatized its Hong Kong-listed business-to-business subsidiary and is expected to launch a listing of the group. Suning’s latest financing push underscores the efforts of online retailers to scale up their physical operations in ways that offer shoppers more choices and convenient deliveries. Ji Weidong, executive director of Morgan Stanley Asia, said the next year or two will determine whether these financial bets will pay off. He calls the coming months “the most critical time” for online retailing in China. How Long Can China Control Its Economy? Some companies have spent hundreds of millions of yuan to hire workers, build logistics centers and open warehouses around the country to streamline customer orders. 360Buy.com is counting on benefiting from logistics and distribution services that it has been building since 2007. The network includes a nationwide delivery system and nearly 20,000 logistics staff. The company plans to invest 10 billion yuan between 2012 and 2014 in warehouses and distribution networks. Suning appears to have an advantage in its established logistics and warehousing network, which was originally built to feed its chain of 1,724 store nationwide. Since going online in 2010, the company has expanded the network to accommodate e-commerce customers. Alibaba’s Taobao, in business since 2003, is the most experienced e-commerce company among the industry titans. It’s also lapping up far more revenues than any other player. Market research firm Analysys International said Taobao deals accounted for 76% of the nearly 279 billion yuan in transactions posted by all online retailers in China during the second quarter. Alibaba, which originally started as a business-to-business platform, has been a pioneer in China’s business-to-consumer market and credited with cultivating online shopping habits among Chinese consumers. But Alibaba’s model has basically been fixed, and its efforts to seek new breakthroughs, such as connecting its shopping platform with social network services, have had little effect. For China’s e-commerce titans, the War of 2012 is expected to be “a battle for survival,” said Ji Weidong. “Unless white-hot fighting strategies are employed, there will be no room for survival” in online retail.

TCEHY	A previous version of this report misstated the direction of the Chinese markets over the previous five sessions. The story has been corrected. HONG KONG (MarketWatch) — Most Asian markets ended lower Friday as a slowdown in China’s July exports and imports dragged on sentiment and led investors to lock in profits before the weekend, with Li & Fung Ltd. and some other stocks also hurt by weak earnings reports. The broad declines reflected heightened worries about China’s economic growth outlook, after July data showed China’s trade surplus narrowed during the month as growth rates for both exports and imports fell below estimates. Read more on Chinese trade data. “The combination of weaker external demand and sluggish domestic investment suggests that the probability of a third-quarter GDP growth recovery is diminishing.

TCEHY	SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — Consumers in the U.S. frequently line up to pay $60 apiece for each year’s installment of Activision Blizzard Inc.’s biggest franchise, “Call of Duty.” Activision A scene from “Call of Duty: Black Ops II.” Activision has made a special online version of the game for the Chinese market, that will be free to play. But when the venerable war-simulation shooting game reaches China’s shores later this year, Activision ATVI, -2.96% is taking a different tack: giving it away for free. The Santa Monica, Calif.-based, company is responding to the peculiarities of the fast-growing Chinese market, where game consoles barely have a presence and people typically play videogames in PC-laden Internet cafes — often in free games that are supported by sales of virtual goods. In this case, Activision will try to make money on its free “Call of Duty” by selling items to help users play the game, such as enhancements for their weapons or extra gear. But the China version is not simply a rehash of existing titles. Shares of Activision rose more than 3% to $12.33 on Tuesday morning, following the company’s formal announcement of its deal to bring “Call of Duty Online” to the Chinese market. The company says this version is completely new, with a different design and storyline that took two years to produce. Activision created the game at a studio in China to ensure it would appeal to gamers’ tastes there, said Bobby Kotick, Activision’s chief executive. TimeActivision Blizzard Inc.15 Jan29 Jan12 Feb26 Feb12 Mar26 Mar US:ATVI $65 $70 $75 “The game is incredible,” he said. “How you play, what you play, customization of weapons, the types of characters, the equipment you use, the game modes, and the maps are all unique to the Chinese market.” The game is being fine-tuned for the PCs gamers use in China’s Internet cafes, the company says. And while there will be an intricate storyline for the game — as is typical with many games from the series — Activision also is including the popular multiplayer options, with specialized digital shootout locations that were designed with Chinese players in mind. Activision invested about the same amount of money producing “Call of Duty” for China as it does for one of the installments in the U.S., Mr. Kotick said. Analysts estimate the games cost at least $50 million to produce each year. The move is a risky one, analysts say, because Chinese consumers are so different from those in the western world. But the market is large and growing, representing an important opportunity. “No one’s done it really well yet,” said Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Securities. He said many Chinese gamers have grown accustomed to buying virtual goods in lower-quality games. So, it’s possible they might be willing to pay even more in a game with higher production values. In addition, he said, war-simulation shooting games have become popular there, creating an inroad for the “Call of Duty” games. “It’s a good experiment and a worthy one.” Recreating the game for the Chinese market, using a Chinese studio, also will likely help draw customers. The game will be marketed with a slightly different title: “Call of Duty Online.” “You can’t simply go into China, open the doors, and say ‘Here’s our product, go play it’,” said Edward Williams, analyst at BMO Capital Markets. He added that many game makers tend to release games in pieces over there, creating the basic struts of the game at first and then filling it in as more people play. Microsoft's Web Woes Wipe Out Profit “If you start off with as big a budget as a traditional console game and hope you generate enough money, there’s a substantial amount of risk,” he said. The move is not Activision’s first in China. The company inked a deal to bring its “World of Warcraft” online fantasy game to China seven years ago. But “Call of Duty” is an even more lucrative franchise, drawing throngs of excited fans to launches that typically come during the holiday shopping season in the U.S. The latest installment, “Modern Warfare 3,” in which gamers play soldiers from various countries shooting through firefights around the globe, sold about 6.5 million copies in its first 24 hours, grossing more than $400 million, making it one of the biggest videogame launches ever. Activision’s Mr. Kotick said he believes the time and effort put into tailoring the game for the Chinese market will help to cement its success there, too. To help bring the game to market, Activision signed a multiyear agreement with Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700)  TCEHY, -2.58%  , a popular Internet company in China that offers games, social networking and e-commerce. Martin Lau, Tencent’s president, said his company was devoting “substantial” resources toward promoting the game, though he declined to say how much. But, he said, the title will be positioned as a star product in the company’s game lineup. He added that while “first-person” shooting games--called such because the player experiences the game as if he or she is looking through the main character’s eyes--are a large and mature market in the U.S., these types of games are still a nascent genre in China and have a lot of potential to grow. “’Call of Duty’ has established itself as the gold-standard in gaming for years,” he said. “We believe its online version will be very well-received by gamers in China.” The game will go into public testing later this year, following regulatory reviews.

Activision created the game at a studio in China to ensure it would appeal to gamers' tastes there, said Bobby Kotick, Activision's chief executive. ""The game is incredible,"" he said. ""How you play, what you play, customization of weapons, the types of characters, the equipment you use, the game modes, and the maps are all unique to the Chinese market."" The game is being fine-tuned for the PCs gamers use in China's Internet cafes, the company says. And while there will be an intricate storyline for the game--as is typical with many games from the series--Activision also is including the popular multiplayer options, with specialized digital shootout locations that were designed with Chinese players in mind. Activision invested about the same amount of money producing ""Call of Duty"" for China as it does for one of the installments in the U.S., Mr. Kotick said. Analysts estimate the games cost at least $50 million to produce each year. The move is a risky one, analysts say, because Chinese consumers are so different from those in the western world. But the market is large and growing, representing an important opportunity. ""No one's done it really well yet,"" said Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Securities. He said many Chinese gamers have grown accustomed to buying virtual goods in lower-quality games. So, it's possible they might be willing to pay even more in a game with higher production values. In addition, he said, war-simulation shooting games have become popular there, creating an inroad for the ""Call of Duty"" games. ""It's a good experiment and a worthy one."" Recreating the game for the Chinese market, using a Chinese studio, also will likely help draw customers. The game will be marketed with a slightly different title: ""Call of Duty Online."" ""You can't simply go into China, open the doors, and say ""Here's our product, go play it',"" said Edward Williams, analyst at BMO Capital Markets. He added that many game makers tend to release games in pieces over there, creating the basic struts of the game at first and then filling it in as more people play. ""If you start off with as big a budget as a traditional console game and hope you generate enough money, there's a substantial amount of risk,"" he said. The move is not Activision's first in China. The company inked a deal to bring its ""World of Warcraft"" online fantasy game to China seven years ago. But ""Call of Duty"" is an even more lucrative franchise, drawing throngs of excited fans to launches that typically come during the holiday shopping season in the U.S. The latest installment, ""Modern Warfare 3,"" in which gamers play soldiers from various countries shooting through firefights around the globe, sold about 6.5 million copies in its first 24 hours, grossing more than $400 million, making it one of the biggest videogame launches ever. Activision's Mr. Kotick said he believes the time and effort put into tailoring the game for the Chinese market will help to cement its success there, too. To help bring the game to market, Activision signed a multiyear agreement with Tencent Holdings Ltd. (0700.HK), a popular Internet company in China that offers games, social networking and e-commerce. Martin Lau, Tencent's president, said his company was devoting ""substantial"" resources toward promoting the game, though he declined to say how much. But, he said, the title will be positioned as a star product in the company's game lineup. He added that while ""first-person"" shooting games--called such because the player experiences the game as if he or she is looking through the main character's eyes--are a large and mature market in the U.S., these types of games are still a nascent genre in China and have a lot of potential to grow. ""'Call of Duty"" has established itself as the gold-standard in gaming for years,"" he said. ""We believe its online version will be very well-received by gamers in China."" The game will go into public testing later this year, following regulatory reviews.

TCEHY	"By LORETTA CHAO BEIJING--After wresting control of his company's boardroom in a battle with Yahoo Inc., the founder of Alibaba Group says he is focused now on a bigger challenge: managing runaway growth at the Chinese e-commerce giant. ""We don't have any experience. We don't know how to organize,"" Jack Ma said in an interview. The pace of growth threatens to overwhelm Alibaba, which Mr. Ma, a former English teacher, started in his apartment 13 years ago. Today, Hangzhou-based Alibaba has more than 23,000 employees. Taobao and Tmall, the company's shopping websites, are expected to host a trillion yuan ($157 billion) in transactions this year, up 150% from 400 billion yuan in 2010. Taobao and Tmall are each less than 10 years old. One of the most serious questions for Mr. Ma is whether China's infrastructure can handle the growing number of parcels flooding the country's streets everyday. Compared with the U.S., Japan and Europe, logistics infrastructure in China is ""terrible,"" Mr. Ma said. China is likely to exceed $785.6 billion in annual online retail sales in five to 10 years, he predicted. That is ""at least one to two times Wal-Mart [Inc.]'s global sales,"" he added. ""What's stopping it? Logistics."" He also worries that Alibaba's growth will hinder the company's ability to make decisions quickly in China's fast-changing market. ""As CEO, when everybody sees good things, I have to see bad things."" Alibaba has emerged from a tough year, including a fraud scandal involving some of its employees; a dispute with Yahoo over ownership of online payment company Alipay, now controlled by a separate company owned by Mr. Ma; and protests from users over increased fees. All this has led many people, including users and prominent Chinese journalists, to question the altruistic image Mr. Ma likes to project. ""I've grown up 10 years, mentally. And I now know how to deal with these things in a much better way,"" Mr. Ma said. ""You don't expect everybody to understand you. It's unrealistic. But 20, 30 years later, people will understand what we did. And this is called leadership."" Mr. Ma pointed to two of the first steps to address Alibaba's wider challenges: the company's recent move to privatize Alibaba.com Ltd. (ALBIY, 1688.HK), a website listed in Hong Kong that connects buyers around the world with Chinese manufacturers; and a deal announced in May for Alibaba to buy back as much as half of Yahoo's roughly 40% stake in the Chinese company. Alibaba will raise the money for the buyback from other investors. Executives needed more freedom to make business decisions, Mr. Ma said. He added that a diversified ownership gives Alibaba a ""long, sustainable and healthy shareholder structure."" Mr. Ma is now in the midst of seeing Alibaba through a reorganization announced last year in which he split the company's domestic consumer-shopping business into three different units ""because we were too slow."" Taobao was ""one huge group,"" he said. The decisions that needed to be made for the different parts of its business ""were all different, and if you wait for the one guy to make decisions, it's too late. So we had to separate, make sure they moved faster."" Taobao and Tmall are doing well individually, analysts say. Taobao's flagship business is an eBay.com-like site that caters largely to small merchants selling price-competitive, largely nonbranded goods and novelties. Tmall hosts online storefronts for branded products, including Gap Inc. of the U.S. and the Uniqlo arm of Japan's Fast Retailing Co. Mr. Ma expects transactions at Taobao and Tmall to exceed a trillion yuan this year, or more than two times the value of transactions across all of eBay's online marketplaces in 2011, excluding purchases of vehicles. Alibaba Chief Financial Officer Joe Tsai said Thursday that Taobao, which earns its revenue from advertising and other value-added services, and Tmall, which earns commissions from its merchants, collectively earned about $1.8 billion in revenue last year, and are likely to experience ""very robust"" growth in 2012, consistent with the rest of China's e-commerce industry. He added that, unlike other Chinese e-commerce companies, which analysts say have single-digit profit margins, Taobao and Tmall both have margins of more than 50%. ""Most companies, when they're doing good, they enjoy today's wonderful life. They don't worry about five years later-but I worry about five years later,"" said Mr. Ma. ""When we have power, the luxury of beautiful sunshine, let's fix the roof."" Taobao and Tmall also face growing competition for users from e-commerce companies such as Tencent Holdings Ltd.'s Paipai and Beijing Jingdong Century Trading Co.'s 360buy.com. In addition, they are challenged by brick-and-mortar businesses such as Gome Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd. and Suning Appliance Co., which recently introduced e-commerce sites. Research firm Analysys International says Taobao and Tmall had 70.8% of all online transactions in China in the first quarter of this year but that their share is declining slightly each quarter. Some online shopping sites actually own storefronts on Alibaba's Tmall. Mr. Ma, who frequently quotes Chinese philosophers, said he is undaunted by rival e-commerce models. ""Ninety-nine percent of them are American e-commerce copycats,"" he said. They are ""too late,"" he added. The entrepreneur, who started Alibaba without a background in business or technology, is seen as a role model for Chinese small-business owners. Many flock to Hangzhou to hear him speak at Alibaba's annual Alifest conference for customers and media. Mr. Ma makes most of his speeches dressed as he appeared on Thursday, in a plain polo shirt and Chinese peasant-style cloth shoes--a nod to his desire to show he hasn't changed since Alibaba's early days. Mr. Ma said he is loathe to hear people refer to his business as an empire. ""I did not change my entrepreneurial spirit, and I did not change my idealism,"" he said. But Mr. Ma still shows off his success in other ways, such as by appearing with celebrities including NBA star Kobe Bryant, who attended Alifest in 2009, and former U.S. President Bill Clinton. His interview with The Wall Street Journal in Beijing took place in a Park Hyatt Hotel conference room elaborately decorated in gold tones, reserved for the China Entrepreneur Club, a nonprofit organization of China's 50 most influential business leaders. Other members of the club include Wang Shi, chairman of China Vanke Co., China's biggest property developer, and Li Shufu, chairman of Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., which owns Volvo Cars. Mr. Ma, 47 years old, says he has stepped back from day-to-day operations and is cultivating a new generation of leaders for Alibaba Group, adding that after multiple failed retirement attempts, he realized the need to prepare younger executives for serious challenges. ""Years ago, I made a lot of decisions myself. This year, I make them make decisions,"" he said, referring to the nine executives who lead Alibaba's various business units. Mr. Ma said he hasn't been to the office in more than two months. ""I'm answering less and less e-mails. Of 100 e-mails I receive, I only answer one or two, and I answer in less than three sentences. Most of the time, it's only [a few] words: 'What do you think?' "" he said. Mr. Ma said he remains close to Alibaba, but more as a mentor to a workforce with an average age of 26. He still has ambitions for Taobao to compete globally. ""I cannot say exactly how we're going to [compete globally], but definitely we're going to do it,"" he said, pointing out that there are far fewer differences among young consumers, enabling Internet companies to become more international. ""If we cannot do something like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft or IBM, I will regret it."" -Write to Loretta Chao at loretta.chao@wsj.com"	June 7, 2012 8:43 p.m. ET	1	Alibaba's next challenge is managing growth: WSJ	https://www.marketwatch.com/story/alibabas-next-challenge-is-managing-growth-wsj-2012-06-07
TCEHY	HONG KONG (MarketWatch) — While U.S. markets focused on the impending debut of Facebook Inc., Chinese social-media major Tencent Holdings Ltd. got some positive attention of its own Friday, helped by a broker’s price-target upgrade and a timely reorganization. Tencent (700)  TCEHY, -2.58% which operates the Twitter-like microblogging service Tencent Weibo, managed to significantly outperform the market, ending the morning session 0.8% lower, compared with a 2.3% drop for the Hang Seng Index, of which Tencent is a component. The move came a day after J.P. Morgan lifted its price target for Tencent to 276 Hong Kong dollars ($35.53), an increase of HK$1 from its prior target, while keeping its overweight recommendation. Tencent shares ended Friday morning at HK$222.40. On Wednesday, Tencent reported a 2.8% rise in first quarter profit, helped by improvements in advertising revenue, as well as gains in its online game division. China's Internet Stocks a Mixed Bag In a note Thursday, J.P. Morgan cited Tencent’s line of 10 game titles with more than 10 million average monthly users each. In an expected move Friday, Tencent announced it would set up a wholly owned subsidiary called Tencent E-Commerce Holding Co. to manage its “fledging” business, effectively segregating it from the rest of the company. The new e-commerce unit was part of a larger restructuring, dividing the company in six business groups. See report on Tencent reorganization. In a note following the announcement, J.P. Morgan said the holding restructure for the e-commerce unit was a good idea. “This may enable future outside investment to fund the business, alleviating Tencent’s capital expenditure burden,” J.P. Morgan analysts said in the note. The broker also praised as “timely” the plan to reorganize internally into six business groups, saying the move would help eliminate overlap of personnel and resources. Tencent currently has around 20,000 employees, whereas its existing corporate structure was put in place in 2005 when it employed around 2,000. The changes will help to shorten the decision making process and encourage a greater “entrepreneurial spirit,” J.P. Morgan said.

TCEHY	TOKYO (MarketWatch) — South Korean and Hong Kong stocks tumbled Friday as many Asian markets ended the week with deep losses after a surprise loss from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. bruised sentiment, with Japanese shares declining after disappointing results from Sony Corp. Taking losses into a seventh straight session, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index (HSI) lost 1.3% to 19,964.63, while South Korea’s Kospi (SEU) finished 1.4% lower at 1,917.13 and Japan’s Nikkei Stock Average (100000018) fell 0.6% to 8,953.31.

Chinese Banks Approved to Expand in U.S. Peter Esho, chief market analyst at City Index in Sydney, said J.P.

JPM, -2.49% revealed after the U.S. markets close. Read more on J.P. Morgan's surprise $2b loss. “The fact that they said it could get worse really got people questioning what else could come, and whether this might be a window of opportunity for other investment banks with losses to come out and announce them,” said Esho. The day’s performance brought a poor week to an end for Asian benchmarks, with the Hang Seng Index sinking 5.3%, while the Nikkei Average skidded 4.6%. The losses came despite a positive U.S. lead, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -2.34%  snapped a six-session slump overnight, helped by a fall in jobless claims and signs of stabilization in Europe.

TCEHY	HONG KONG (MarketWatch) — The hype over Facebook’s initial public offering has helped put the shine back on China’s social-media stocks, as share prices of the biggest players rebounded from a slide sparked by concerns over Chinese accounting and corporate governance issues. Nasdaq-listed Sina Corp. SINA, -2.65% operator of China’s leading micro blog Weibo, rallied 5.2% on Wednesday to end at $73.89. In spite of the jump, Sina’s share price remains well below an intraday high around $145 last April. Other Chinese Internet and social-media-related companies were also higher amid news that Facebook Inc.’s FB, -1.34%   filing puts it on track as the largest debut ever for an Internet stock. New York Stock Exchange-listed RenRen Inc. RENN, +3.97%   fell 10%, after sharp gains since Friday, when headlines on the Facebook’s IPO circulated. Once the Facebook offering was officially announced late Wednesday, however, RenRen rose 2.6% in after-hours trade. Facebook Files, Revenue Short of Expectations Meanwhile, Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700)  TCEHY, -2.58%   were up 1.2% in Hong Kong’s Thursday afternoon session. In addition to its core online gaming business, Tencent owns China’s top social-networking site QZone, along with an undisclosed state in Kaixin, another popular Facebook-style site. The company also operates China’s No. 2 micro blog Pengyou. Tencent has seen its shares rise sharply in recent weeks, reversing a decline that began in April. Sina shares, along with other Chinese Internet stocks, suffered a broad sell off last year that accelerated in June after Carson Block and his firm Muddy Waters LLC levelled fraud allegations at Toronto-listed Chinese timber company Sino-Forest. An independent committee investigating fraud allegations issued a final report Wednesday, but didn’t offer a firm conclusion on whether the company valued its assets correctly. Facebook’s China question Facebook’s IPO highlights the value of social media and indirectly draws attention to the potential of China and its 500 million Internet users, few of whom however can “friend” Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg because of regulations that block the company from entering. In its IPO filing, Facebook said it is continuing to evaluate prospects in the world’s most populous nation, though it acknowledged barriers in the form of “substantial legal and regulatory complexities.” It also sounded a note of caution on issues relating to censorship and data privacy that might be necessary to win approval from Beijing. “We do not know if we will be able to find an approach to managing content and information that will be acceptable to us and to the Chinese government,” Facebook said. But censorship would just be one of several issues facing a potential Facebook move into China. Recent equity research highlighted important differences in China’s approach to social media, where micro blogs more popular than the social-networking platform pioneered by Facebook. J.P. Morgan analysts said that cultural preferences in mainland China place more emphasis on content than connectivity to other users. They said that in 2011, traditional social networks in China were overtaken by micro blogs in terms of subscriber growth and user activity. Social-network users have declined since a peak of 235 million in December 2010. Meanwhile, the popularity of micro blogs has continued to surge and likely overtook social networks in registered users during the second half of 2011, J.P. Morgan said in a January report on the sector. Geared towards online games, the networking sites were a draw for students and young professions but saw limited appeal among other demographic groups, the investment bank said.

TCEHY	The stragglers in the race for China's online video market are fading fast. But with the internet giants muscling in it's too early for market leader Youku to declare victory. A sharp increase in the cost of content has increased the rate of attrition in the online video industry. Fierce competition has bid up the price of popular content like Chinese soap operas tenfold in the last year, according to analysts at China-focused research firm RedTech Advisors. That is bad news for smaller players like Ku6, PPTV, and Xunlei that typically have less cash. Especially as frozen capital markets mean they have little chance of raising more. High costs for content will mean frugal reserves are exhausted even faster. The big winner seems to be Youku. The company's decision to tap the capital markets at end 2010 and in the first half of 2011 looks smart. Youku is sitting on $594 million in cash and short-term investments. That's considerably more than $183 million for rival Tudou, which missed the sweet spot for Chinese internet IPOs when it came to market in August. The departure of smaller players will clear the field, and advertising revenue continues to surge. But it is too soon for Youku - which has still to show a profit - to start popping the champagne corks. The entry of major players like Baidu, Sohu and Tencent-integrated giants that loom large in China's online search, portal, and instant messaging sectors - means Youku's leadership position is far from secure. Firms like Baidu throw off huge volumes of cash from their main business that can be used to fund big spending on online video. As important, they can leverage their existing online presence to direct users toward their own platform, at the expense of dedicated video sites. Market sentiment on China's internet sector is not what it was. Reflecting that, and a growing recognition of the competitive pressures in the sector, Youku's share price is 74% off its April peak. Youku might soon see off its smaller rivals. But the big dogs of China's internet will not be shaken off so easily. Investors waiting for online video's potential to turn into profit may find their patience wearing thin.

TCEHY	"--Global X Social Media Index ETF set to be launched Tuesday --ETF to offer investors exposure to ""full"" social-media sector --Lack of Facebook, Twitter gives fund heavy international exposure (Updates with money-manager comment in paragraph five and timing of stock purchases in paragraph 10.) NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Investors in the first exchange-traded fund for social media--set to be launched on Tuesday--will not only buy into Groupon Inc. GRPN, -0.91% LinkedIn Corp. LNKD and similar companies, but will also get significant international exposure, particularly to China. The Global X Social Media Index exchange-traded fund is expected to start trading Nov. 15 on the Nasdaq, under the symbol SOCL. Tracking 25 stocks, including some of this year's most closely watched initial public offerings, the fund aims to be ""a pretty simple way to make sure you're exposed to the full sector,"" said Global X Funds chief executive Bruno del Ama in an interview. It also promises a more volatile ride than broader technology ETFs. During Friday's light-volume stock-market surge, the Nasdaq Composite gained 2%, but LinkedIn rose 2.7%, characteristic of the exaggerated moves seen in brand-new tech stocks that face considerable growth expectations. Investors' hopes for social-media stocks have surged this year amid well-received initial public offerings such as LinkedIn's, but the public markets still don't have Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc., the twin heavyweights of U.S. social media. The surge of interest has conjured memories of the Internet bubble of the late 1990s for many investors. ""There will be winners and there will be considerably more losers,"" said Channing Smith, co-portfolio manager at Capital Advisors Growth Fund. ""There will be tremendous advertising opportunities. But like any time the 'next greatest thing' hits, you've got to take a step back to understand the business model and how these companies are going to make money--the sustainability of the business model."" The lack of Facebook and Twitter in U.S. markets is one reason the Global X ETF will have a surprisingly high international exposure. At least for the time being, there is more exposure to Chinese social-media companies than to Silicon Valley, since large social-media companies are in several cases more established in public markets overseas. The fund's weighting consists of 26% U.S. stocks. Chinese companies represent 37%, including 10% apiece for Internet giants Tencent Holdings Ltd. (0700.HK), Sina Corp. SINA, -2.65% and Netease.com Inc. NTES, -1.92% The U.S. group includes Google Inc. GOOG, -2.02% weighted at 4.75% because its earnings heft remains in other businesses. That is the same weighting given to Pandora Media Inc. P, -1.85% and to Groupon. LinkedIn Corp.'s is 3.5%. Three Japanese stocks get more than 19%, while Russian, German, Indian, Taiwanese, Italian and U.K. social-media stocks also have representation. The focus will almost certainly shift in favor of the U.S., said del Ama, as the fund adds new holdings. It may be a while, though. Most recently, Facebook was said to push its plans for an IPO back to late 2012. Last month, Twitter's chief executive said the company doesn't want to be ""beholden to an IPO window."" The ETF is slated to add new social-media stocks after their IPOs, and won't be able to buy them beforehand, meaning it won't benefit from the first-day pop seen in several of this year's social-media offerings. LinkedIn soared 109% on its first day of trading in May. It will be seeded with $1.5 million in capital ahead of Tuesday's open, a Global X representative said. Like ETFs generally, the fund promises to smooth out the volatility of individual stocks, but it is sure to reflect investors' extremes of sentiment toward a closely watched group of new stocks. ""It is not a utility sector [ETF]. It's a very young industry,"" said del Ama. ""A lot of these companies are just turning around to profitability or showing significant growth. When you have those dynamics, it's just much more difficult to value."" More from MarketWatch Can the Democrats Ride a Blue Wave to Midterm Election Wins?

TCEHY	NEW YORK (MarketWatch) –– With the U.S. market teetering and European stocks sinking under the weight of debt fears, investors understandably have been looking for other countries to pin their hopes on. What about China, whose economy has long captured the excitement of investors eager to capitalize on its rapid growth? Chinese stocks ended higher Thursday, buoyed by talk that the national pension fund had bought a large chunk of shares to stabilize the market. Yet the day’s stock rise masked deeper fears that have pressured Chinese stocks over the past year. Asia Today: Yuan on the Rise The Hang Seng Index is down 15% so far this year, while the Shanghai Composite Index is off 8.1%. China is a polarizing force for investors -- one that has been shrouded in emotion and rhetoric for much of this year. Weighing on investor sentiment: inflation jitters, concerns about its slowing economy, suspicions about sketchy accounting and fears about emerging-market growth stocks. Yet the Chinese stock market, which tends to be characterized with broad brush strokes, is a nuanced one. With the variety of stocks and index-linked funds to choose from, investors can tap its diversity and hedge their risks. Rules of thumb: be careful with policy-sensitive sectors; pick shares of companies with transparent, open accounting; stay broad-based, and keep a lid on expectations. 1. Focus on transparent accounting A number of accounting scandals have dampened faith in Chinese stocks. Look for companies that are more transparent with their books, which tend to be found on major global stock exchanges. “The ‘supermodels’ have tended to go overseas,” said Jonathan Masse, portfolio manager at Baochuan Capital Management LLC. Disclosure standards are generally stricter on the Hong Kong and New York stock exchanges than on Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges, he noted. “Investors may feel more confident about companies listed on the main boards of stock exchanges as they are generally subject to more regulatory scrutiny than smaller boards,” such as the Nasdaq Pink Sheets, added Chin-Ping Chia, head of research for the Asia Pacific at MSCI Inc. Be wary of so-called reverse-merger companies, said Andy Mantel, chief executive of Pacific Sun Advisors. Chinese companies that go public through the reverse-merger route combine with shell companies that are already listed, and so are able to avoid much of the scrutiny that comes with an initial public offering. With the wealth of capital and more listed entities in the U.S. to serve as shell companies than in Hong Kong, reverse-merger companies are more likely to list on U.S. stock markets, Mantel added. In contrast, the Hong Kong stock exchange forces such back door listings through a tighter disclosure process by considering them new offerings, unlike in the U.S., said Jamie Allen, secretary-general of the Asian Corporate Governance Association. Because these companies enter through the back door, they are targets for short-sellers eager to jump on accounting irregularities — and their shares can be extremely volatile. For example, when forestry company Sino-Forest Corp. SNOFF  (TRE) was hit by fraud accusations by research firm Muddy Waters LLC in June, its stock plunged. Sino-Forest denied the accusations. That didn’t stop John Paulson’s Paulson & Co. hedge fund from unloading its entire stake in the company. But others, such Singapore-based investment group Richard Chandler Corp, took the stock’s tumble as a buying opportunity, and shares have since recovered slightly. 2. Pick dividend-paying stocks “Companies that pay dividends provide an extra measure of objectivity,” said WisdomTree Investments’ Director of Research Jeremy Schwartz, “They can’t fake a dividend.” WisdomTree Emerging Markets Equity Income Fund DEM, -1.83% an exchange-traded offering, tracks an index measuring the performance of the higher dividend-yielding emerging market stocks. Matthews China Dividend Investor Fund MCDFX, -1.94% is a mutual fund that focuses on dividend-paying companies in China and Taiwan. Its biggest holdings as of the end of July included China Mobile Ltd. CHLKF, -0.78% CHL, +0.31% and Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Ltd. (1038) (CHH). “Dividend payers generally have better management teams and are more shareholder-friendly,” said Rob Wherry, an analyst at investment researcher Morningstar Inc. “They tend to have better corporate governance and better balance sheets.” 3. Watch Beijing’s next move Rising real estate and food prices have prompted the Chinese government to tighten the reins on inflation. Accordingly, tread carefully in sectors that could fluctuate as a result of uncertainty about the government’s next move, said Derick Leung, an analyst at Greater China Fund. TimeAberdeen Greater China Fund Inc.15 Jan29 Jan12 Feb26 Feb12 Mar26 Mar US:GCH $13.0 $13.5 $14.0 Greater China Fund GCH, -0.15% a closed-end fund, focuses on companies that generate revenue in yuan and Hong Kong dollars. This provides exposure to the yuan, which has recently appreciated against the U.S. dollar. While real estate is traditionally an inflation hedge, Leung cautioned against keeping shares of Chinese property developers long-term. For example, Guggenheim China Real Estate ETF TAO, +0.00% which tracks an index of real estate companies and investment trusts, is down 11% so far this year. It’s also the wrong time to own Chinese banks, J.P.Morgan analyst Adrian Mowat said in a note in July, projecting that loan growth would slow and credit costs would rise deeper into the tightening cycle. TimeiShares China Large-Cap ETF15 Jan29 Jan12 Feb26 Feb12 Mar26 Mar US:FXI $50.0 $47.5 $52.5 The largest China-sector exchange-traded fund, iShares Trust FTSE China 25 Index Fund FXI, -2.17% tracks companies in the China equity market available to international investors. The ETF is off 14% this year, weighed down by big banks. With a 50% exposure to financials, its largest holdings include China Construction Bank Corp. CICHF, -2.94% CICHY, -2.39% CICHY, -2.39% and Agricultural Bank of China Ltd ACGBY, -2.80%  (1288). 4. Be smart about tech Search engine Baidu Inc. BIDU, -2.55% up 53% so far this year and web portal Sina Corp. SINA, -2.65% up 50%, have grabbed much of the excitement that investors and the media have about the Chinese Internet space. TimeBaidu Inc. ADR15 Jan29 Jan12 Feb26 Feb12 Mar26 Mar US:BIDU $220 $240 $260 But the prices these companies’ shares trade at are reflective of the optimism in these companies, and they are unlikely to provide much upside, said Morningstar senior analyst Dan Su. Also, be wary of smaller companies trying to bring disruptive models into Internet spaces, Su said. Many haven’t proven that they will have a sustainable competitive advantage. Newly-listed Chinese companies that provide technology-related products and services tend to move twice as much as the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index SPX, -2.19% on a weekly basis, according to a MarketWatch analysis of firms newly listed on U.S. stock exchanges since the start of 2010. They swing more sharply and are riskier. Read full story here. Two tech-oriented China ETFs of note have been focused on more mature companies. TimeGuggenheim China Technology ETF15 Jan29 Jan12 Feb26 Feb12 Mar26 Mar US:CQQQ $57.5 $60.0 $62.5 $65.0 Guggenheim China Technology ETF CQQQ, -2.91% has some of its largest holdings in Baidu, Internet service portal Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCTZF, -3.80% TCEHY, -2.58% and online video-game company Netease.com Inc. NTES, -1.92% Meanwhile, Global X China Technology ETF CHIB, +0.00% has top holdings in personal computer-maker Lenovo Group Ltd. LNVGF, -1.89% LNVGY, -2.69% (992), China Telecom Corp. Ltd. CHJHF, -1.03% CHA, -0.92%  and Chinese Internet portal Sohu.com Inc. SOHU, -3.07% 5. Stay broadly diversified Broad-market China ETFs have outperformed both megacap and small-cap China ETFs this year, said Morningstar analyst Patricia Oey. Staying broadly diversified protects against volatile and sluggish sectors. Investors who want to take this approach can look at Guggenheim China All-Cap ETF YAO which tracks an index that limits any one position size to 5% of the portfolio, or SPDR S&P China ETF GXC, -2.52% Large-cap stocks are generally shares of companies with an over $10 billion market value. Big caps are seen by some as safer bets, but can yield lower returns. Megacap laggards in China include the state-owned offshore oil producer CNOOC Ltd CEOHF, +3.40% CEO, -0.74% down 22% this year, China Construction Bank Corp. CICHY, -2.39% CICHF, -2.94% down 23% this year, and Bank of China Ltd. BACHF, +1.87% down 31% this year. The recent spate of accounting scandals, concentrated in smaller companies, has hit small cap stocks especially hard. Guggenheim China Small Cap ETF HAO, -3.06%  is down 21% in 2011. ETFs that focus on Chinese small caps — generally defined as shares of companies with a $1 billion to $2 billion in market value — have less exposure to financials, energy, and telecom companies. Chinese small caps have been more volatile than large caps over the last three years. 6. ‘China for chickens’ Although China ETFs fared better compared to broad emerging market funds in the last five years, concerns about slowing growth are likely to pressure Chinese stocks, Morningstar’s Oey said. For instance, BlackRock’s China-focused iShares MSCI China Index Fund MCHI, -2.40% underperformed the broader iShares Inc. MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund EEM, -1.96% in the four months after the China-focused fund was launched in March. Hold a diversified emerging-market ETF, Oey said; it’s less risky than investing in a China-only ETF. Investors can also consider multinational companies that are pumping resources into China. Many of these companies are well-known in the consumer sector. For instance, Yum! Brands Inc. YUM, -1.80% reported in July that second-quarter profit jumped 10% on growth in emerging markets. LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton LVMHF, -0.27%  (LVMH) is also gaining market share in these developing areas, as is McDonald’s Corp. MCD, -1.65% Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -1.28% and PepsiCo Inc.

China’s Shanghai Composite Index (000001) finished the day 1.3% higher at 2,581.51, South Korea’s Kospi (0100) added 0.6% to 1,817.44 and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 index (XJO) ended little changed at 4,140.8. Each of them erased initial losses. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index (HSI) fell 1% to 19,595.14 and Japan's Nikkei Stock Average (NIK) dropped 0.6% to 8,981.94. Taiwan’s Taiex declined 0.2% to 7,719.09, unable to hang on to early gains. “At the current level, valuations look just too attractive. A lot of people have already sold what they needed to, so maybe there is some room to buy,” said Yoji Takeda, head of Asian equities at RBC Investment. Asia Today: Yuan on the Rise Some reports also cited speculation about state-owned funds as a reason for the support to the Chinese market. Dow Jones Newswires cited a Chinese media account as saying that the National Council for Social Security Fund had bought at least 10 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) worth of stocks since Tuesday. Separately, Takeda pointed to speculation of government institutions in South Korea and Taiwan also being among the buyers. The choppy session followed another day of hefty losses Wednesday on Wall Street, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -2.34%  tumbled 4.6% on worries that European debt troubles were now spreading to France. However, Dow industrials futures jumped more than 1.5% by the end of the day’s trading session in Hong Kong. “We think a sustained rally in risk assets depends on a significant and sustained reduction in euro-zone debt anxiety. It will take either strong global growth or a comprehensive solution to the debt crisis. Neither is the baseline scenario,” said Prakash Sakpal, an economist at ING Financial Markets Research. Movers Gains in Shanghai were led by airline stocks on hopes that steep recent fall in crude-oil prices and a rising yuan would cut their fuel costs, with bargain buyers also snapping up some banks and property developers. Shares of Air China Ltd. AIRYY, -1.09%  (601111) (753) jumped 4.9%, and China Eastern Airlines Corp. CEA, -1.73%  (670) (600115) soared 10.1%; in Hong Kong, they gained 2.9% and 6.5%, respectively. Attractive valuations also pushed several financials higher in the region, with China Construction Bank Corp. CICHY, -2.39%   (939) rising 1.7% in Hong Kong, Cathay Financial Holding Ltd. jumped 5.9% in Taipei, Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  ANEWF, -0.89%  climbing 1.5% in Sydney and Korea Exchange Bank up 3% in Seoul. HSBC Holdings PLC (HSBA)  HBC, +1.71%  (5)  dropped 2.9%, however, as trade resumed after being halted Wednesday afternoon, because of a disruption to the exchange’s corporate-announcements website. In Tokyo, Shinsei Bank Ltd. (8303)  SKLKF, -2.50%  fell 2.2%, and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. MTU, -4.17% (8306) dropped 1.9% after a tumble for their Wall Street peers. In Hong Kong, Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700)  TCEHY, -2.58%  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293)  CPCAY, +2.28%  and Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. (388)  HKXCY, -3.31%  all lost ground — by 4.7%, 2% and 3.3%, respectively — after each reported first-half results. Thursday marked the second day of gains in Seoul after the government there banned short-selling for three months, in the wake of extreme losses. The Kospi is still the worst performer among Asia’s major benchmarks so far in August, with a net loss of 14.8%. UBS strategists advised clients in a report to buy 11 “fallen angels,” including Samsung Electronics Co. and Hyundai Motor Co., following their sharp pullback and the government’s ban on sale of borrowed stock. Samsung SSNLF, -3.07%  fell 1.7%, while Hyundai HYMTF, -11.01%  added 2.3% Thursday. Japanese exporters declined as the dollar dropped below the 77-yen mark. Panasonic Corp. (6752) fell 1.7%, and Sony Corp. (6758)  SNE, -1.44%  surrendered 2.2%. Supporting the Australian stock market, shares of Telstra Corp. (TLS)  TTRAF, -1.33%  rose 5.7% after the telecommunications major’s profits beat analyst forecasts. See report on Telstra earnings.

TCEHY	"--Tencent also to invest in Kingsoft online-security affiliate --Move is Tencent's latest investment to fuel growth (Adds Kingsoft statement in 3rd paragraph, background on Tencent investments in 5th-7th paragraphs.) BEIJING (MarketWatch) -- Chinese Internet service provider Tencent Holdings Ltd. (0700.HK) will buy 15.68% of software developer Kingsoft Corp. (3888.HK) by buying shares from company directors for a total of HK$892 million (US$114.6 million), the company said Wednesday. The move comes as Tencent steps up efforts to make strategic investments and looks for new ways to fuel growth outside its core online businesses like games, messaging and social networking. Tencent will buy the shares from Kingsoft executive director Pak Kwan Kau and non-executive director Cheung Shuen Lung, it said. Kingsoft expects Tencent to complete the purchase on Thursday. Tencent will also make an investment in Kingsoft Internet Security Software, an online-security company,"" it said, without giving details. The two companies will explore further cooperation in the Internet application software and online game markets, Tencent said. The Internet firm has tried to boost growth in recent months by making investments or expanding its own business in areas like online advertising, microblogging and local deals, but analysts expect online games to remain its core growth driver this year. Tencent said in January it would launch a CNY5 billion investment fund to invest in online game companies and other firms. Last month, Tencent Chairman Pony Ma said the firm would double the size of the fund to CNY10 billion. In February the firm said it would team up with U.S. deals website Groupon Inc. to launch a similar website in China, while in May, Tencent bought a stake of around 16% in online travel agent eLong Inc., in a co-investment with Expedia Inc., eLong's largest shareholder."

TCEHY	An earlier version of the story misstated the percentage change for China Railway Erju Co. in Shanghai. The story has been corrected. HONG KONG (MarketWatch) — Mainland Chinese stocks finished lower for an eighth successive session Monday, unable to shake off concerns high inflation will force Beijing to introduce more policies that could result in an economic slowdown. Japanese stocks were pressured by a stronger yen against the U.S. dollar. Many of the regional markets changed direction a few time during a choppy session, amid investor caution ahead of holidays in the U.S. and U.K., as well as the release of data on manufacturing activity later this week from various Asian countries, including China. Typhoon Hits Southern Japan The Shanghai Composite index (SHCOMP)  finished the day 0.1% lower at 2,706.36. Despite attempting to rebound a few times during the session, the index lost the battle to concerns of monetary tightening — a lingering worry that has pulled the stock benchmark more than 7% so far this month. “I think [the Shanghai market] is not too far from the bottom,” said Ben Kwong, chief operating officer at KGI Asia in Hong Kong. However, “I don’t think the market has room for much upside until inflation peaks out and investors believe that there is no more need for further tightening,” he said. He said a decision last week by PetroChina Co.’s parent to acquire shares in the energy company was an indication that valuations were cheap and that the worst may soon be over. The drop came even as Wu Xiaoling, a former vice governor of the People’s Bank of China, said that the country should continue to tighten its monetary policy despite some signs recently of an economic slowdown. China and some other Asian countries are also due to release their manufacturing purchasing managers’ index data for May this week.

TCEHY	HONG KONG (MarketWatch) — As we approach the end of the year, the rise of China and its giant companies is again being hotly debated. Last week a new report on the growth in brand value of China’s largest companies was released and was likely intended as another testimony of the advances made by corporate China. Millward Brown put a brand value on telecoms behemoth China Mobile Ltd. (941)  CHL, +0.31%  of $56 billion, while Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. (1398)  IDCBF, -2.35%  and Bank of China Ltd. (3988)  BACHY, -3.10%  rate at $38 billion and $28 billion respectively. But more than the large values, what is more revealing is the way companies on the list are largely owned by the government. State-owned brands account for 75% of the $280 billion value of the top 50 firms and eight out of the top 10 companies. The survey acknowledges that being part of the state is an advantage due to limited competition in their largely domestic markets and favorable government policies. But move outside that comfort zone, and the value of these brands and companies needs a fresh look. China Strengthens Friendship With India The two non-government owned companies in the top ten are local search engine Baidu Inc. BIDU, -2.55%  and Internet company Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700)  TCEHY, -2.58% Baidu has prospered this year after mainland regulators clamped down on Google Inc. GOOG, -2.02%  — which incidentally tops the global brand value ranks at $114 billion as reported in an earlier Millward Brown study. It might not be state-owned, but Baidu is certainly favored by authorities and works hand-in-hand with government censors. Arguably, only Tencent is truly non-government-aligned, and merits its inclusion on the back of the incredible growth of its QQ instant messenger service which has 636 million users. The prominence of China’s domestic focused state-owned firms looks more of an anomaly in the context of the global brand list. As might be expected, all the top brands are international. You might ask when you have the dream combination of the largest, fastest growing market in the world and limited competition, why would anyone care if you’re an unknown on the world stage? And China now has 7 companies in the global 100, up from 5 last year and one in 2006. But even in a market the size of China, growth has its limits. How many more users can Tencent add, or China Mobile add to its 575 million cell phone subscribers? Perhaps the slower domestic growth explains why China Mobile’s brand value is now 14% lower than 2009. While overseas markets are the obvious growth opportunity, the readiness of China’s top brands to make that leap is questionable. China Mobile has so far only made very tentative moves abroad. Tencent at the weekend announced initiatives to expand overseas with foreign language versions of its service. Now it will have to prove itself in a fair battle against the likes of established Google and Skype Ltd. If China Mobile is thinking of making a plunge overseas, the recent experience of Hong Kong’s Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.’s (13)  HUWHY  3 mobile company in the UK and Europe would suggest caution. It found after a near decade of losses that making profits in the rough and tumble of foreign markets can be far tougher than in protected domestic duopolies in Hong Kong. Notably, mobile operators O2 OTOW, +43.75%  and Vodafone Group (VOD)  VOD, +0.14%  feature in Millward Brown’s ranks of the UK top ten brands but not Li Ka-shing’s 3. One China brand that has made an impact on international markets is telecom equipment maker Huawei. But as a privately held company backed by the People’s Liberation Army, it would not have qualified for inclusion in the survey. Its competitors claim this lack of transparency hides unfair government subsidies. Another issue with these state-owned brands going abroad is the risk of inflaming trade tensions by drawing attention to protected Chinese markets at home. The industries in China’s top ten — from banking and insurance to telecoms — remain those in which it is extremely hard for foreign companies to have any meaningful presence. The elevation of mainland banks to the ranks of super-brands looks particularly questionable. Only five or six years ago, sickly mainland banks and the banking system were widely viewed as the Achilles heel of China’s economic transformation. After the banks listed they were meant to continue on a path to become truly commercial institutions but such reform has been postponed. So you are still left with a system where the currency is not traded, state-owned institutions only trade with other state-owned institutions while interest rates and debt are priced by regulators rather than the market. Where do calculations of value begin? Ultimately China’s brands, like its banks, need to be marked to market with the test of global markets and consumers to prove their value and longevity. Meanwhile, with lingering trade tensions likely to put a break on overseas expansion, once consequence is international brands are likely to remain attractive targets for Chinese companies.

Data released earlier in the day showed China’s consumer-price index jumped 4.4% in October from a year earlier, accelerating from September’s 3.6% rise. The data also topped economists’ estimate of a 4% rise and strengthened expectations for more interest-rate increases. “There will be rate hikes, but the rate hike will itself confirm the upward trend in the renminbi [yuan]. The appreciation is what the hot money is coming in for,” said Steve Cheng, associate director at Shenyin Wanguo. Other data also released during the day showed the Chinese economy was still in good shape, with fixed-asset investment in urban areas rising 24.4% in the January-October period, in line with expectations. Also, Chinese banks extended a higher-than-anticipated 587.7 billion yuan ($88.8 billion) run of new loans in October. Read full story on the Chinese data. The data “provide further evidence that China’s economy is picking up steam after its mild midyear slump,” RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note. “Although the initial reaction to any rate hike in China will likely be negative for risk assets, we suspect that any weakness would be short-lived given that China is normalizing policy from a position of relative strength,” RBC said.

""AOL is not in a position at this time to further fund and support Bebo in pursuing a turnaround in social networking,"" Brod wrote. AOL AOL which was then still a unit of Time Warner Inc. TWX, -0.90% acquired Bebo in March, 2008. At that time, Bebo had attracted a broad following in the U.K. and Ireland, and was seen as a potential rival to more popular social networking services such as Facebook Inc. However, according to data from comScore Inc., Bebo drew in 12.8 million unique visitors in February, down 45% from the same period last year. Meanwhile the number of visitors to Facebook grew 68% over the same period, comScore said. AOL will now decide whether to sell or shutter Bebo, an AOL spokeswoman confirmed. ""AOL is committed to working quickly to determine if there are any interested parties for Bebo and the company's current expectation is to complete our strategic evaluation by the end of May 2010,"" Brod wrote in his email. Brod's email about Bebo was sent in anticipation of a related public filing with Companies House, the U.K.'s government registry. AOL was spun out of Time Warner as an independent entity in December. The company has sought to refashion itself as a provider of online content and news, and services such as Bebo have been widely seen as peripheral. AOL's ICQ instant messaging tool, another service seen as peripheral, has reportedly drawn bids from potential suitors including Russia-based ProfMedia and Digital Sky Technologies, and China-based Tencent Holdings Ltd.

TCEHY	"HONG KONG (MarketWatch) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd. saw its shares drop more than 3% in Hong Kong trade Thursday after the company cautioned the era of rapid growth in the nation's Internet media services market is drawing to a close. ""They are looking at much lower growth rates this year,"" said Macquarie Securities analyst Patrick Yau, referring to the quarterly results, which were released late Wednesday Tencent (700) TCEH should see net income growth ease to around 40% this year, or roughly about half last year's profit growth rate, Yau said. He said the slow-growth tone was reflected by senior company officials during a post-results conference call Wednesday. ""Management was alluding to the growth rate coming off and the market being more mature,"" Yau said, adding that he downgraded his outlook on the company to neutral in January amid mounting concerns China's Internet market was entering middle age. Tencent shares ended the morning trading session 3.3% lower Thursday in Hong Kong. Tencent, the ninth-largest constituent of the Hang Seng Index by market capitalization and by weighting, said Wednesday its fourth-quarter net income totaled 1.51 billion yuan ($221.2 million), up 74% from 869.1 million yuan a year earlier. That was in line with the 1.57 billion yuan average estimate of analysts polled by Dow Jones Newswires. The Shenzhen-based company, which specializes in online game platforms and other Internet services, said revenue rose 76% to 3.69 billion yuan from 2.10 billion yuan. J.P Morgan said the quarterly results were slightly better that its expectations, and maintained its recommendation that investors overweight the stock. ""The synergy between instant messaging and social network services will lead to stronger user engagement and as a result, higher monetization capability,"" wrote J.P. Morgan analyst Dick Wei. Slowdown ahead But despite the upbeat results, Tencent also cautioned the huge growth in Internet subscribers had begun to cool. ""After years of rapid growth in penetration, the growth rate of new users is poised to slow over time,"" the company said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange. Last year, China's Internet user-base expanded 28.9% to 384 million, while its mobile Internet population rose by 99% to 233 million users. Still, Tencent said Internet use would grow but that such growth would be more tepid and harder won.

TCEHY	"SHANGHAI (MarketWatch) -- China Mobile Ltd. CHL, +0.31% the world's largest mobile carrier by subscribers, said it has no plans to acquire Tecent Holdings Ltd. (0700.HK). In a statement over the weekend, China Mobile spokeswoman Rainie Lei said recent media reports that China Mobile is in talks with Tencent is ""groundless."" Hong Kong-listed Tencent runs the popular Chinese instant messaging system QQ. The statement came after local Internet portal Ifeng.com cited sources as saying over the weekend that a China Mobile delegation led by the company's president Wang Jianzhou visited Tencent headquarters and the two sides held a discussion over the potential acquisition. Tencent, which was established a decade ago, led China's instant messaging market with its average daily users reaching 137.5 million, the official Xinhua News Agency reported in November. China Mobile launched its own instant messaging service, Fetion, in 2006, to attract more subscribers as part of an effort to increase its revenue. According to the Xinhua report, by the end of September, Fetion ranked the third among instant message programs after Tencent and Microsoft Corp.'s MSN. As well as the instant messaging service QQ, Tencent also operates various online platforms, including Web portal QQ.com, games portal QQ Game, and a mobile portal. Officials at Tencent weren't immediately available for comment. More from MarketWatch Can the Democrats Ride a Blue Wave to Midterm Election Wins?

TCEHY	"HONG KONG (MarketWatch) -- Among the obstacles China must overcome as it speeds through its roll-out of third-generation mobile technology, one is especially problematic: Few customers seem to be interested. Early indications are that cell-phone users in the world's largest telecom market aren't flocking to the concept of digital lifestyles via their handheld devices -- at least not yet. ""So far it's not been encouraging,"" said BOC Intern telecom analyst Allan Ng, referring to uptake rates for third-generation, or 3G, service plans that went out earlier this year. ""Consumers have not been very keen on 3G, which has been the case around the world."" That wasn't supposed to happen. According to the pre-launch logic, China's rising wealth, fast-growing subscriber base and tech-savvy consumers meant the new technical standard would find strong traction. But as last week's quarterly operating results from China Mobile Ltd. (941) CHL, +0.31% showed, mainland Chinese consumers aren't taking to 3G in a big way. The Beijing-based company reported 700,000 new subscribers to its 3G service during the third quarter. That brings its total 3G subscriber base to 1.65 million accounts, equivalent to just 0.3% of its 508.4 million subscriber base. The Chinese government has said it expects users of 3G services to reach about 240 million among the nation's three carriers within three years. Early results from rival China Unicom (762) CHU, +0.47% -- the official carrier of the iPhone, which launched its 3G service Oct. 1 -- aren't much better. The company reportedly secured only 10,000 pre-orders for the 3G version of Apple's Inc. AAPL, -2.56% smart phone during the annual week-long holiday that ended in early October. Costly handset prices, hefty prepayment costs and a lack of built-in Wi-Fi connectivity were cited as concerns. Analysts now wonder whether China's Big Three telecoms -- which also includes China Telecom Corp. CHA, -0.92% (728) -- could be left hanging when it comes to profits in the 3G era. Operator investments on networks totaled 295 billion yuan in 2008, a rise of 30% on year, outpacing a 12% rise in revenues. A further 450 billion yuan in 3G projects is planned by operators in the next three years, according to government estimates. Declaring war The market for 3G may be showing little in the way of increases so far, but competition, on the other hand, does seem to be rising. ""I think there will be a 3G price war in China,"" said Francis Cheung, head of Asia Telecoms at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets. Cheung said the era of fast growth in revenues is over, with the industry now set to struggle against ""commodity-like"" tariff pricing, where rates differ little between competitors. As a case in point, CLSA forecasts China Mobile's earnings will rise just 2% in 2010, as aggressive price-cuts and handset subsidies erode gains from the telecom's monthly average of more than 5 million new subscribers. Analysts at the Royal Bank of Scotland echoed those sentiments, saying China Mobile's earnings will likely ebb after touching a high-water mark this year. ""We expect upside to the share price to be limited, given rising competition,"" said RBS analyst Wendy Liu following the results. For the most part, analysts say China's telecoms still belong in one's portfolio because of their steady stream of dividend payouts, but they won't be the growth stories they once were. An 'older' market One problem in this regard is the maturity of the Chinese market. Telecom companies' shares tend to perform best when cell phones are a relative novelty -- what analysts call the ""hyper-growth"" phase, when penetration rates rise from near zero to about 40% of the population. A portfolio of telecom companies' shares tracked by CLSA had risen 50% to 60% a year between 2003 and 2007. At this point, China's cell phone penetration rate is about 55%, still below the median 92.9% across Asia. But Cheung says it will ""be hard to generate these kinds of returns going forward because it's a much more mature market,"" adding he prefers Indian telecoms as growth stories because the market is at a younger stage of development. This sort of logic, on the face of it, would seem to be bullish for 3G sales, since the technology is still relatively new to the Chinese market. Operating licenses were only handed out in January, although trials had been underway in a few locations since 2008. So far, 3G has been extended to about 40 mainland Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and affluent urban areas along the east cost. Coverage is expected to reach 280 cities, including the poorer central and western regions , by year's end. And even in the areas which already have 3G service, more investment is likely. Users of China Unicom's service in Shanghai, for example, are reportedly struggling to get reliable signals indoors. But the building out of a 3G market is different from the rapid growth seen when mobile phones are first introduced into a given market. Macquarie analyst Tim Smart says evidence suggests China's 3G customer base should rise to about 15% to 20% of the overall penetration rate, if it follows the pattern in other emerging markets. And even that level of usage may not be enough to offer a big jump to the telecoms' earnings. Smart says that in countries with track records of two to three years in 3G service, ""data usage us often is just able to offset falling spending on voice."" Shares are aware Hong Kong-listed shares of the Chinese telecoms seem to be pricing in diminished prospects for the industry. After outperforming the broader market by about 10% last year, the telecoms have lagged this year's rally in the benchmark Hang Seng Index. Some of that skittishness could reflect the aforementioned concerns that carriers will slash their service-plan costs and increase handset subsidies to lure customers. Talk of price competition heated up after China Unicom slashed its 3G service charges and offered a more tempting iPhone package during its roll-out earlier this month. Similarly, China Mobile is reportedly planning to ramp up handset subsidies to a total of 30 billion yuan in 2010, an increase of 150% from this year's level. In such an environment, BOCI's Allan Ng said he's skeptical China can avoid the stream of red ink that's been seen during 3G roll-outs in Europe and Hong Kong. ""Basically the only thing you can do is lower your prices and get people to use it,"" he said. ""You are not getting much in terms of revenue, or revenue growth. And of course you are incurring a lot of costs, so you have no growth, or earnings decline. That's what most of other carriers have experienced and I wouldn't be surprised if that is the case in China."" An alternative For those investors still hoping to play China's progress in the tech space, CSLA's Cheung sees Chinese Internet companies as a better idea. Many of these names, such as search group Baidu Group BIDU, -2.55% and online gaming group Tencent Holdings (700) TCEHY, -2.58% will likely make money off of content for 3G phones, but more importantly they also stand to benefit from a well developed fixed-line broadband infrastructure. ""The mobile boom is replaying, but this time in the Internet companies,"" Cheung said. This stands in contrast to other emerging markets, such as India, which have little in the way of broadband. There, Internet companies aren't expected to reach a truly wide audience until the roll out of ""4G"" services that should enable much more usage of the Web via wireless phones.

TCEHY	HONG KONG (MarketWatch) -- This week all eyes will be on China initial public offerings, with debutants on the new growth enterprise (GEM) market further swelling the ranks of new listings. Only days ago it looked as if the new GEM market had timed its launch to perfection with record interest in China IPOs. But last week two new issues in Hong Kong, as well as the Shanda Games Nasdaq listing, all closed below their issue price. See full story on Shanda IPO. China's long awaited new second- board and its listing pioneers could face a tough initiation. The new board is positioned as China's answer to Nasdaq and will cater to innovation-orientated start-up and tech based companies. Twenty-two companies have been approved to list, with trading expected early next month. But have we not been here before? My first concern is simply the title: GEM. Hong Kong, too, introduced its own GEM market in 1999, also during an IPO bull run. The thinking was this lesser board would allow entrepreneurial growth companies without the three- year profit track record required of the larger concerns listing on the main board to access funds. In the end, many Hong Kong GEM market listings were those by wealthy tycoons, who opportunistically found a way to get quick money and listings (Hutchison Whampoa's (13) HUWH TOM Group, or Sun Hung Kai Property's (16) SUHJ SUNeVision for example), without the nuisance of building a business that runs at a profit. Investors quickly lost interest, and GEM became a badge of dishonor. As soon as companies qualified, they made a beeline for the main board. Hong Kong already had enough burned-out, illiquid penny stocks and the GEM market just seemed to add to that. Proof is in the caliber Will China's new bourse be different? As a general rule, the discipline of showing a track record of profit is not something to be disregarded lightly. China's GEM market requires only one year of profitability, but sales growth must have topped 30% for at least two years. Among the factors that will make or break the new market, perhaps the most important is the quality of the companies that get to list. China is different from most equity markets as the government effectively still decides who gets to list. The main exchanges are dominated by the well-connected state-owned enterprises. The hope is this GEM market will provide a new platform for private companies to go public who are currently shut out there. The proof will be in the caliber of the companies that make it. HSBC Securities says the companies originally chosen to list all exceed the listing requirements. Then there is the matter of pricing. Again, the regulator -- the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) -- has more influence than its counterparts in the West. Two years ago, the issue was under-pricing A-share IPOs, but now has it gone the other way? A concern is stocks might be too aggressively priced to max out on the speculative sentiment. These new GEM candidates have been reportedly priced at an average PE ratio of 55 times earnings -- and some of up to 70 times -- which could just be asking for trouble. How these stocks perform post-listing will depend on the emergence of an educated investor base. Some of the commentary has focused purely on the smaller size of the issues, which makes ramping up the share price much easier. Qualified foreign financial investors (QFFI) will be allowed to invest in the GEM market, although involvement will likely depend on liquidity and research coverage. HSBC says it expects A-share fund management companies to introduce ETF products on the GEM market, so there should be a way for those outside China to get exposure. At the moment there are so many issues coming out of China, GEM could struggle to get attention. We already have China listed A and B shares, as well as H shares listed in Hong Kong and China listings in the U.S. and Singapore. If the new board does go well, perhaps it will make Hong Kong nervous that it will chip away at its dominant capital markets role, or maybe the U.S. may get fewer Chinese listings? Today, however, both Hong Kong and Nasdaq still attract the best pick of China's tech stocks, splitting the likes of Baidu BIDU, -2.55% Netease NTES, -1.92% Tencent TCEH (700) and Alibaba ALBCF (1688) between them. To achieve lasting success, ultimately it is not how a listing fares on day one that will matter, but its performance years down the line -- its ability to sustain interest, valuations and wide participation by institutional investors in its shares. Much will come down to the company's underlying performance and on a cautionary note, GEM listings will need to do better than recent small and medium enterprises (SMEs) listed in China. According to HSBC in its review of 52 SMEs that listed on the A-share market in 2006, sales growth decelerated consistently from 34% year-on-year in the IPO year to 22% a year after the IPO -- and then dropped 8% three years after the IPO. Investors need to know these companies view arrival on the GEM board as the start of their journey as public companies, not merely as an end-game exit by their founders.

Through its Full-Featured games model, Tapinator is creating sustainable, franchise-like games that each have the potential to bring in $100 million or more in revenues and which boast product lifespans of at least five years. TAPM employs a set of proprietary dynamic development and marketing processes factored on gaming category, approximated player retention and predicted player profitability. Headquartered in New York, Tapinator has product development teams in the U.S., Germany, Pakistan, Indonesia, Russia and Canada. Among its current endeavors, the company is actively exploring virtual reality and augmented reality opportunities and has exploratorily released various prototype virtual reality games to gather data before pursuing a more significant product in this category. Tapinator additionally intends to pursue publishing transactions that leverage its network, platform relationships and operational expertise, and management is delving into significant opportunities to expand the company's gaming IP to new platforms like Steam and to leading messaging apps. All of these attributes, achievements and pursuits make Tapinator an attractive potential M&A target for larger players seeking a piece of the mobile gaming pie-and such companies have been in plentiful supply. Companies like Tencent Holdings Limited TCEHY, -2.58% have made significant acquisitions in the mobile games space in recent years, such as the much-publicized 2016 majority stake acquisition of SuperCell to the tune of $8.6 billion. Microsoft MSFT, -2.33% is certainly no stranger to big acquisitions, and near the end of 2014 the tech giant finalized its acquisition of Mojang, the creator of ""Minecraft,"" for $2.5 billion. In February 2017, Take-Two Interactive TTWO, -4.06% made its move into the mobile gaming space with a $275.9 million acquisition of Social Point, while even more recently-in early November 2017-gaming giant Zynga ZNGA, -2.27% announced it had entered into an agreement to acquire the mobile card game studio belonging to Peak Games for $100 million. These are just a few examples of big players sitting up, taking notice and taking action to cash in on the red-hot mobile games market. As 2018 draws nearer and mobile games continue to ever more firmly establish a stronghold as the fastest-growing sector within the gaming space, continued acquisition action could spell good news for micro-cap companies like Tapinator.

TCEHY	"NEW YORK, November 7, 2017 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- NEW YORK, November 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The videogames market is a unique one, in that the success of individual companies is primarily driven by the release of hit games, leading to significant ebb and flow as new games are either embraced or panned by players. For this reason, many have long considered mobile gaming companies to be poor candidates for venture capital funding. However, there are always exceptions, and various mobile gaming stocks have proven their strength and longevity in the marketplace. Players like Tapinator, Inc. TAPM, -7.17% (Tapinator Profile), Nintendo Co., Ltd. NTDOY, -2.36% Zynga, Inc. ZNGA, -2.27% Glu Mobile, Inc. GLUU, -1.35% and Electronic Arts, Inc. EA, -2.37% have shown their staying power and are among standout public companies gaining market share within the videogame industry. Each of these entities is currently gearing up to once again raise investor interest with highly anticipated new game releases coming down the pipe. In the mobile games industry, it is quality rather than quantity that drives the potential of profitability, as evidenced by the huge success of entities like Finnish game developer Supercell. Tencent Holdings TCEHY, -2.58% purchased an 84-percent stake in Supercell in 2016 for $8.6 billion. At that time, the transaction valued Supercell at a whopping $10.2 billion (http://nnw.fm/t2Bal). Incredibly, Supercell only has four games in the marketplace. Nevertheless, it is a giant in the mobile gaming industry due to the success of those titles, which have produced a lifetime average of $1.15 billion in revenue solely on the iOS platform, as reported by VentureBeat (http://nnw.fm/lNO37). Other companies are similarly striving to find success with well-designed, user-hooking mobile games that cater the modern gamer. For Tapinator (OTCQB:TAPM), the upcoming releases of 'ColorFill', a unique puzzle game which is set to launch in December 2017, and other new titles are set to arouse interest among both gamers and investors. Tapinator is a leading developer and publisher of mobile games on the iOS, Google Play and Amazon platforms, engaging millions of players worldwide with its portfolio of more than 300 mobile games. Again, quantity doesn't always equate to success, but it's important to note that Tapinator's games have collectively amassed more than 400 million player downloads and counting. Most recently the company announced (http://nnw.fm/kuhL5) its partnership with Hanover, Germany-based development studio Robot Cake Games. Through this partnership, Tapinator has acquired the rights to publish 'ColorFill', a distinctive puzzle game aimed at attracting fans of games like Minesweeper, Sudoku and other popular puzzle titles. The partnership also gives Tapinator the right to publish future Robot Cake titles for a period of at least one year, with 'ColorFill' being among the first to roll-out under the Tapinator banner. 'ColorFill' is currently being soft launched in Canada and Australia, and the game is slated to hit the global landscape on December 7, 2017, just in time for the holiday shopping season. ""We have known the team at Robot Cake for several years and have been highly impressed with their hard work, creativity and the quality of their products. We are excited to announce the beginning of a long-term partnership that we believe will result in future successful, top grossing game launches,"" Tapinator CEO, Ilya Nikolayev said in announcing the partnership with Robot Cakes. ""We at Tapinator are fans of 'ColorFill's' innovative gameplay and are excited to partner with Robot Cake to bring this unique title to millions of app store players. 'ColorFill' is our first release with Robot Cake and we expect that it will be the first of many. We look forward to providing updates on other scheduled releases from this partnership in early 2018."" Other new Tapinator titles coming up during Q4 2017 and Q1 2018 include 'Divide & Conquer' and 'Fusion Heroes'. The company also recently released two new Full-Featured Games, 'Big Sport Fishing 2017' and 'Dice Mage 2'. 'Big Sport Fishing 2017' scored over 520,000 player downloads within the first week of its worldwide release, and both it and 'Dice Mage 2' were distinguished as ""New Games We Love"" on the Apple iOS platform (http://nnw.fm/Xy3V5). Tapinator has been hailed as 'One to Watch' (http://nnw.fm/Hv38g) within the mobile gaming market, garnering considerable notice with hundreds of thousands of daily downloads on the iOS, Google Play and Amazon platforms. Through consumer app store transactions and the sale of branded advertisements, the company continues generating attractive and predictable returns. Tapinator's business strategy includes the creation of best-in-segment full-featured games that garner long-term player retention and produce higher ROIs-games like 'ROCKY [TM] ' and 'Solitaire Dash'. Employing this Full-Featured Games model, the company is able to create sustainable, franchise-esque games with the potential of bringing in $100 million+ each and boasting product life spans of five years or greater. Tapinator uses a set of proprietary dynamic development and marketing processes that are factored on gaming category, estimated player retention and projected player profitability. The company's diversified revenue resources include 54 percent that comes from in-game advertising and 46 percent that stems from consumer purchases made via app stores. Within the company's games, advertising placement is strategically limited to appear only between game levels, which helps bolster player retention, and players are further enticed to participate in watching video ads on a rewards basis. Additionally, Tapinator is actively exploring opportunities in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) and has released several prototype virtual reality games on an exploratory level in order to gather data before pursuing a more significant product in this area. The company further plans to pursue additional publishing opportunities that leverage its large player network, platform relationships and operational expertise. Another highly anticipated mobile games release on the radar, and one likely to generate notable investor buzz, is coming soon from Nintendo NTDOY, -2.36% An undeniable pioneer in the videogame world, Nintendo recently made its most significant move yet in mobile gaming with the announcement of plans to add 'Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp' as its third title for smartphones. The game is scheduled to launch in late November and is anticipated to be a long-term cash generator for Nintendo. It will be available as a free download for both iOS and Android and will feature in-game purchases. Nintendo's stock has climbed 80 percent during 2017, and Goldman Sachs has estimated that an 'Animal Crossing' mobile title could bring in twice as much revenue as Nintendo's two previous smartphone games combined. The company has announced its intention to launch between two and three smartphone games per year going forward. Meanwhile, mainstay mobile games player Zynga ZNGA, -2.27% has commenced a soft launch of a sequel to its hugely popular game 'Words With Friends'. 'Words With Friends 2' features various updates, including new game modes and 50,000 new words added to the game dictionary. During 2017, Zynga's stock price per share has risen from $2.69 in early January to $3.88 on November 2, reflecting, at least in part, the interest generated by this release. When 'Words With Friends 2' launches worldwide, investor attention is likely to increase. For Glu Mobile GLUU, -1.35% it is hoped that the upcoming release of 'The Swift Life' - scheduled for release in late 2017, according to company information, without a hard-and-fast specified launch date - will generate significant buzz and investor interest. More a social environment and digital entertainment platform for Taylor Swift fans than an outright game, 'The Swift Life' chiefly lets fans of the Grammy winner connect and interact with each other as well as with the star herself through message boards, quizzes and other such features. The project marks a departure from the format of Glu Mobile's prior celebrity-focused games and will actually be the company's first pop culture celebrity app to be unveiled in 2017, as some of its previous celeb-game efforts didn't fare so well. Because of Taylor Swift's astronomical fan following and the app's format of being a social network rather than a game, those in the know believe it has a very good chance of being a successful and profitable app for Glu Mobile. Another hugely popular full-featured game that is currently in soft launch is 'The Sims Mobile' from Electronic Arts EA, -2.37% This mobile version of the popular life simulation game could well prove to be-and likely will be-as enormously successful as its full-featured counterpart. Electronic Arts' stock price has been steadily climbing for several years and has continued that trend in earnest during 2017, rising from $80.784 on January 1 to $115.21 on November 1. The release of the wildly popular 'Sims' in mobile version can only serve to bolster that growth. The launches of these highly anticipated mobile games are likely to kindle significant interest among investors, proving once again that mobile gaming stocks belong in the publicly traded arena. When it comes to savvy and successful game launches, mobile gaming companies like Tapinator demonstrate that they are certainly not playing around For more information on Tapinator, visit Tapinator, Inc.

TCEHY	"NEW YORK, October 16, 2017 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- NEW YORK, October 16, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- According to a research report published by Transparency Market Research, the global Mobile Payment Technology (MPT) market is expected to be worth US$1,773.17 billion by the end of 2024 and growing at a CAGR of 20.5%. The report indicates that currently, the MPT market is expanding at a higher rate due to the increasing adoption of smart phones and tablets across emerging economies. These developing regions, such as Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa are showing strong support for adopting payment technologies as governments are initiating cashless economies. Analysts anticipate that Asia Pacific will lead the pack in the coming years as it is slated to account for a share of 42.5% in the global market by the end of 2024. Glance Technologies Inc.

TCEHY	"LONDON, September 28, 2017 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- LONDON, September 28, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- According to KPCB, there are 2.6 billion gamers worldwide - that's 2.6 billion people turning to video games for relaxation, entertainment or to kill time on the bus or metro. The Institute for the future estimates that gamers spend well over 3 billion hours per week playing games on smartphones, laptops, PCs, hand-held devices, and gaming consoles like Microsoft's Xbox or Sony's Playstation. Video games, which used to be considered a niche market with little mass appeal, has grown 26x in the last 20 years to become a hugely valuable part of the modern technology consumer market. Companies in focus today include: Intel Corporation INTC, -3.16% Snap Inc. SNAP, -0.97% Microsoft Corporation MSFT, -2.33% Tencent Holdings Limited TCEHY, -2.58% Dell Technologies Inc. DVMT, -2.09% What's more, it's a market with tremendous diversity. While some game developers focus on single-platform releases with high name-recognition, on a model similar to big-budget movie releases (think of Halo, Call of Duty, Destiny, FIFA), others try to carve out a new market through innovation. The rise of hand-held, casual gaming has also presented opportunities for games-based marketing, direct-to-consumer advertising and micro-transactions that can turn a single game into a cash machine for whichever company develops it. Savvy investors, therefore, have a lot to choose from. Here are just a few companies looking to take advantage of the gaming boom that investors can look to for strong current and future growth: 1. Nintendo Co., Ltd.  The famous developer was a pioneer in the gaming industry thirty years ago. After passing through a rough period, amidst fierce competition for platform market share with Sony and Microsoft, Nintendo has bounced back. Recent quarterly earnings were $1.37 billion, a leap of 150 percent from a year ago. Expectations for future profits are high, thanks in large part to Switch, a new gaming platform that debuted earlier this year. Light, portable and multi-purpose, the Switch has driven strong sales for Nintendo, which expects to move 10 million units in this fiscal year. Nintendo shares have jumped to a 52-week high and now sit near $42. An analyst from Credit Suisse forecasts the company will sell 130 million units through 2022. The reason is the platform's small size, which has allowed it to be marketed like a hand-held despite its design as a traditional platform, and the positive buzz it's generated since its debut. A few years ago, market-watchers were unsure that Nintendo could stage a comeback. Those doubts look like they've been put to rest. 2. Versus Systems, Inc. ( VS ; VRSSF ) The rise of PC and mobile gaming has brought with it a potent opportunity for advertisers, as well as a significant challenge. The new, and fast-growing market of interactive media advertising is set to become a $7 billion market by 2019, according to Statista - but game developers, and brands have yet to hit upon a scalable, flexible solution for in-game brand engagement. As video games and interactive media look to surpass TV, radio, and movies as the most-consumed forms of media in the world, companies looking to expand their brands and attract new customers have found it difficult to penetrate gaming in a way that appeals to users. Versus Systems, Inc. has developed a bold new way to address these problems. A small-cap company with some big ambitions, Versus seeks to do for gaming what Google AdWords has done for search ads, and what Facebook has done for social media advertising. The Versus approach centers on prizes and promotions. The Versus platform allows game developers and publishers to offer real world rewards in-game. When players win matches, or reach specific in-game achievements, they are rewarded with real prizes that are sponsored by brands they likely already engage with. The Versus platform connects players' in-game behavior to real-world rewards. This system eliminates the need for intrusive pop-ups or advertising unconnected with the gaming experience, making the games more engaging and fun while allowing brands to reach the most engaged audience on earth. Versus is inked a major deal with 704Games, the company with exclusive rights to develop games for NASCAR, which, according to Forbes, was the biggest spectator sport in the United States. NASCAR has over 1000 brand sponsors, which means hundreds of brands that Versus could potentially harness for prizes and promotions in 704Games' new releases on mobile, PC, and console. Versus' model should attract more developers like 704Games, as it drives additional player engagement and creates a new revenue stream for game developers through these targeted prizes and promotions. By creating additional reasons for players to play longer and more often, and by sharing the advertising revenue from brands looking to engage with players, Versus aligns the incentives of the game developers, players, and brands - all of whom want to create a seamless and engaging experience for players. Versus is poised to solve one of gaming's biggest challenges: how to work with brands and advertisers in a unique way to make games more engaging for the world's 2.6 billion gamers. With a system that integrates ads in an organic, experienced-based way, Versus (CSE: VS; OTC: VRSSF) could be the company that really breaks open the box on this enormous, and fast-growing market. 3. Dell Technologies DVMT, -2.09% Once one of the world's largest computer manufacturers, Dell suffered some significant set-backs when it ran into competition from newer, leaner tech companies. The company has since recovered and is pushing some new frontiers in gaming tech, including VR and high-performance gaming rigs and laptops. In January the company announced a range of new gaming laptops. Dell's premier brand, Alienware, which markets mostly to casual gamers and those looking to customize their gaming experience, will be releasing new models in 2017 in all three size ranges. Apart from its Alienware brands, Dell has marketed its Inspiron laptops to more budget-conscious consumers, or those looking to get a slightly less-bulky gaming model. The Dell Inspiron 15 is sleek, dependable and comes in at just $799 (the cheapest Alienware is $999, and that's before customization). These popular brands, name-recognition and strong marketing has made Dell the top name in laptops, both for dedicated gamers and casual consumers. Dell share price has been on the up-swing since January 2017, rising from $54 to a current high of near $77. Should the company continue to prosper, its likely share price will increase by an even greater margin. 4. Tencent Holdings TCEHY, -2.58% A major player in the rapidly-expanding realm of ""esports,"" Tencent Holdings owns Riot Games, the developer of the popular League of Legends. Esports, the genre of hand-held and online games that allows players to compete with one another, often for money prizes. Tencent Holdings is a Chinese tech giant based out of Hong Kong. Along with Alibaba, it's widely considered one of the most dynamic Chinese tech firms. Its resources are immense, as evidenced by its $8.6 billion acquisition of Supercell, the Finnish developer of hand-held games like Clash of Clans, another popular title. Games held by Tencent attract massive audiences. League of Legends, just on its own, saw 14 million people view its championship tournament, with 30 million tuning in at some point or another. With its acquisition of Supercell and its constant expansion into the esports and handheld gaming realms, Tencent Holdings looks set to continue its rise. Share price traded in the U.S. has shot up like a rocket since January 2017, rising from $25 to $40, and there doesn't seem to many signs that the share price will decline any time soon. Tencent Holdings is definitely a strong buy for anyone looking to burnish their gaming portfolio. 5. Asustek Computer Inc.   While not strictly a gaming stock, the Taiwan-based laptop manufacturer Asustek maintains a presence on the gaming market with its range of affordable, multi-purpose laptop computers. After a rough few years, where it launched an expensive foray into the realm of smartphones, the company set about restructuring in 2016 and early 2017. It's now set to re-engage markets and focus more heavily on its gaming laptop division, according to the Nikkei Asian Review. The strategy seems to be working. The company expects revenues in Q3 of 2017 to grow 15-20 percent on last year, with a major rebound coming in late 2017 and stability in 2018. While sales volumes are expected to be lower, with only about 18 million units moved in 2017, higher item prices means bigger profits, while cost-cutting will improve overall free cash flow. Many PC gamers prefer to use high-end gaming rigs, which can run in the $2000 or $3000 range. Gaming laptops, however, have become increasingly popular. Light, cheap and capable of playing even new games on lower graphics settings, the proliferation of affordable gaming laptops from Asustek and other developers indicates how the market has grown. Recent research shows that gaming hardware sales were $26 billion in 2016 and likely to rise above $30 billion by 2017. While ""heavy"" gamers accounted for 46 percent of total sales, they constituted only 3 percent of the total consumer base. Should Asustek succeed, it could tap into that potential market and reap some significant profits. Other companies to have on your radar : Microsoft MSFT, -2.33% is one of the most innovative and well-known companies within the tech sector, but with its Xbox video game system, the company has made waves in the gaming world. Microsoft's Xbox Live gave gamers a way to communicate, face off, or make purchases on an entirely new platform. The landmark addition created an ease of access that has changed the gaming market forever. But Microsoft is appealing to investors for more than just its gaming platform. Like Intel, Microsoft is diving head first into an entirely new market. With key partnerships utilizing and implementing blockchain technology, the company's upside could have huge potential as the tech takes off. Snap Inc. SNAP, -0.97% To much fanfare, Snap IPO'ed earlier this year and managed to surprise many analysts. Snap Inc. operates as a camera company. It offers Snapchat, a camera application that helps people to communicate through short videos and images. The company also provides a suite of content tools for partners to build, edit, and publish snaps and attachments based on editorial content. The company IPO'ed at $17 and quickly saw its share price reach $25, before falling back to IPO levels and below. While snapchat continues to look for ways to innovate, investor sentiment in this stock has soured and some now see it as a 'dead stock walking' Intel Corporation INTC, -3.16% is a leader in multiple fields of technology. The forward thinking industry giant is the backbone of many laptops and PCs running the Windows operating system. The company has been so successful in its deal-making and advertising that it is impossible to escape its influence. Not only is Intel running our laptops, it may soon be taking over the financial industry. As a leader in the blockchain push, Intel has partnerships with banking heavyweights worldwide. Intel is also expanding its reach within the Internet of Things, creating new ways to receive, process, and store data. Savvy investors are definitely following Intel closely, as many see it as a leader in the race to create an entirely new internet. September to drive more demand for HDMI 2.0 products. By.
